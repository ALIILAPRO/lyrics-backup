		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Galaxies swarming behind me
Nebulas lying ahead
This can only mean
That I have arrived into space, oh yeah
I feel the astral fire burning
It's blazing deep inside of me
It burns for the steel, my steel

Fly high into space to charge my
Laser Powered Goblin Smasher
With the force of solar fusion
Flowing through my veins
My steel will blow you away
Fighting mega battles every day

Glory! Hammer!
Wielding steel that is true
Glory! Hammer!
Since 1992
Glory! Hammer!
For the King of Dundee, my destiny
Glory! Hammer!

My hammer will not surrender
It fights until I'm to die
Now time has come
To regain its powerful might, once more
Celestial light of new dimension
Fill my maul with glory
For all that is real, yeah

Fly high into space to wield my
Thunder Striking Wizard Thrasher
The dawn of another reality
Reinvigorates
My steel will blow you away
Fighting mega battles every day

Forged by ancient Gods of warfare
Wrought of lasers from the sun
Now suffused with astral fire
It is the time for battle
Every knee will bow before me
Every goblin king will fall
Now the time has come to
Regain our fallen pride once more

Fly high into space to raise my
Heavy Metal Darklord Crasher
With the stars of this universe now
Lying in my hands
My steel will blow you away
Mighty prince with a licence to slay
Fighting mega battles every day

It is my destiny
To rule the Galaxy
I am the one
The chosen son
Glory! Hammer!

On the wings of his jetpack, with the newly invigorated power of the Hammer of Glory in his hands, Angus returned to the resistance base in the Land of Unicorns to prepare for the final assault on the evil sorcerer. Ralathor stood waiting for his arrival.
It is time! bellowed Ralathor. Now that Angus McFife wields the power to defeat Zargothrax, we must strike! HOOTS FORCE, ASSEMBLE!. Suddenly the waters of Loch a' Chroisg began to stir violently, and from the depths rose a great flying nuclear submarine, with the name DSS HOOTSFORCE' emblazoned on the side. This was the secret weapon of the resistance army!  And with a glorious battle cry, the forces of justice set course to the Battlefield of Cowdenbeath, for the final battle against Zargothrax.
