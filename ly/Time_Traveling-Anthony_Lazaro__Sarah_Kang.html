		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wondering if thousands of miles away 
The sky's just as blue
It's as if I'm stuck in yesterday
When I'm thinking of you
'Cause when you have your morning coffee 
I'm turning out the lights so I could dream 
And when you smile through the screen
I wish you could be here with me
So I'll lay my head to rest 
When the sun is rising
And I'll start a brand new day 
When the moon is shining
I long to be with you
In all the places you have been 
So today, I am time traveling 
Oh today, I am time traveling
Everytime that you are closing your eyes 
I will be beside you
And my heart will glide across the miles 
To fly right to you
'Cause when I dive into the traffic 
The echo of your voice is all I hear 
I'm never tired of your laughing
So far but ever so near
So I'll lay my head to rest 
When the sun is rising
And I'll start a brand new day 
When the moon is shining
I long to be with you
In all the places you have been 
So today, I am time traveling 
Oh today, I am time traveling
So I'll lay my head to rest 
When the sun is rising
And I'll start a brand new day 
When the moon is shining
I long to be with you
In all the places you have been 
So today, I am time traveling 
Oh today, I am time traveling
