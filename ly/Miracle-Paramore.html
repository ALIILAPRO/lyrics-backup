		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've gone for too long
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and I

When this memory fades
I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
With chances taken, hope embraced
And have I told you

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

We've learned to run from
Anything uncomfortable
We've tied our pain below
And no one ever has to know

That inside we're broken
I try to patch things up again
To calm my tears and kill these fears
But have I told you, have I

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

It's not faith if
If you use your eyes
You'll lie
We'll get it right this time (This time)
Let's leave this all behind
Oh, I will get it right this time
It's not faith if you're using your eyes
Oh, I...

Well I've gone for too long
Living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and

I don't want to run from
Anything uncomfortable
I just want no
I just need this pain to end right here

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
'Cause it might save you

Yeah, it might save you
Oh, it might save you
It's not faith if you
If you use your eyes
If you use your eyes
If you use your eyes
