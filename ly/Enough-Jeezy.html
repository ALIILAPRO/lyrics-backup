		  If you grind strong enough
If you grind long enough
If you grind hard enough

Oh Lord, I woke up this morning and started praying
And only niggas feeling my pain, know what I'm saying
Dear Lord, street life ain't no game, know what I'm saying
It's for my money really, fuck the fame and I ain't playing
See I passed the rock a couple of times, let me assist
Nigga me and ya'll together how the fuck we gonna miss
Nigga all we worry about is how the fuck they gonna flip
Cut the window drop things, I swear to god they gonna trip
Meet the haters meet the feds, now that's gotta be a sign
Smoked a blunt and laughed about it, writing lose my mind
Hit the booth and spazzed out, almost lost my mothafuckin' mind
Bought a mic for these hoes, you know my mothafuckin' grind
Sleep is the cousin of death, and I'm alive
Thug Motivation plus inspiration equals survive
They tryna rob me of this success with no disguise
I know that shit was hard on you Young, the way you grind

(If you grind hard enough)
You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G
(If you grind long enough)
You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stand on top and tell these hatin' ass niggas it's the world

I'm on deck, on point, I'm straight, I'm cool
Got the whole 500, drop dead old school
Live by the G Code nigga, I don't break no rules
And when I was in the streets I ain't see no dues
All I know, come through use the kitchen do the dishes
Rock hard say your prayers say your muhfuckin' wishes
Jizzle what you do you sick of hopping out a 'Coupe
Cop a four door nigga hop up out it in a suit
Giorgio Armani, still represent the struggle
I'm in this Giorgio Armani, still represent the hustle
See a man made the clothes, clothes never made the man
And if a nigga tell you different he ain't seen a hundred grand
All I heard is what I couldn't do, All I heard is what I couldn't be
Yet I'm still determined on these niggas, just look at me
Sometimes I lay up in my bed, think 'till my head hurt
Fuck raps I'd rather stress, yeah we call that bad work

(If you grind hard enough)
You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G
(If you grind long enough)
You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stand on top and tell these hatin' ass niggas it's the world

Okay now fuck that bullshit, get off ya muthafuckin' ass
You working with yourself you grind that muthafuckin' half
And when you grind that half you pay your muthafuckin' staff
And then you take the hood you do muthafuckin' math
Fuck that ho bullshit, get off your muthafuckin' ass
Get off your fuckin' ass nigga stack your fuckin' cash
And when you stack your cash you pay your muthafuckin' staff
And then you take the world you do the muthafuckin' math

(If you grind hard enough)
You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G
(If you grind long enough)
You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stand on top and tell these hatin' ass niggas it's the world
