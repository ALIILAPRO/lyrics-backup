		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was busy thinking 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreaming 'bout boys
Boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinning thinking 'bout boys

I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all
I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me I'm all alone, but
I'm looking down and my girls are blowing my phone up
Them twenty questions, they asking me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
"I had to trash the hotel lobby"

But I was busy thinking 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreaming 'bout boys
Boys, boys
Head is spinning thinking 'bout boys

In every city I got one with different ringtones
Flying from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are calling me asking me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I can't even lie, you got me

I was busy thinking 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreaming 'bout boys
Boys, boys
Head is spinning thinking 'bout boys

Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (no, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it
Even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (no, no, no, no)
Missed what you were saying
I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad, not like I had a choice

I was busy thinking 'bout boys
Boys, boys
I was busy dreaming 'bout boys
Boys, boys

I was busy thinking 'bout boys (boys)
Boys (boys), boys
I was busy dreaming 'bout boys
Boys (oh, baby), boys (yeah)
Head is spinning thinking 'bout boys
