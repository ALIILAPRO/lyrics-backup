		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's my vicious little sister
She picks your pockets when you kissed her

Vicious little sister breaking bottles
All I wish for you is bad luck and a chance for love
The sun is coming up, you're coming down

And all the boys and girls are smitten
She just wants a sharper knife
Before the muzzle comes off, you're bitten
A dirty deed done twice

She's my vicious little sister
She picks your pockets when you kissed her

Vicious little sister making trouble look romantic
They want nothing but the worst for you
Cuts and bruises, lipstick stains and lies

And all the boys and girls are smitten
She just wants a sharper knife
Before the muzzle comes off, you're bitten
A dirty deed done twice

She's my vicious little sister
She picks your pockets when you kissed her

She's my vicious little sister
She picks your pockets when you kissed her
