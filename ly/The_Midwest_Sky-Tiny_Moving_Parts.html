		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see your smile
I can see your smile shine so brightly through the window
I can't get used to this
I can't get used to this

Our wishing well cracked in the concrete
The water fled, our love went obsolete
I can't get used to this
I feel so different

Pitch black clouds
Dance above the Midwest sky
All the time
I try to block them out with my makeshift satellite
I try to shut them down
I try every night

The front door is closed
But I can see your smile
Shine so brightly through the window
There's a fascinating canvas painting that dwells in the corner of my skull
You made my life worth living when I was incapable

A small portion would make me feel I was worth something
I want to exist in your heart just a little bit (a little bit)
Exist in your heart just a little bit (a little bit)
A small portion would make me feel I was worth something
I want to exist in your heart just a little bit (just a little bit)
Exist in your heart just a little bit

I just want to exist
For a second
There is nothing left to hold
Blown out candle smoke
You made my life worth living when I couldn't

I can see your smile
I can see your smile shine so brightly through the window
I can't get used to this
I can't get used to this

A small portion would make me feel I was worth something
I want to exist in your heart just a little bit
Exist in your heart just a little bit
A small portion would make me feel I was worth something
I want to exist in your heart just a little bit (a little bit)
Exist in your heart just a little bit (a little bit)
A small portion would make me feel I was worth something
I want to exist in your heart just a little bit (just a little bit)
Exist in your heart just a little bit

Pitch black clouds
Dance above the Midwest sky
I try to block them out
I try to shut them down
I try every night
