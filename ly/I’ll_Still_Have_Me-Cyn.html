		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I broke my back 'cause
I thought you would too i'd run in circles
I thought you would too

Maybe in another life
Everything worked out alright
And things that made this harder passed us by
But there's no bad dream to wake up from
Know I got it bad when it's the morning
And you're all that's on my mind

If I don't have you
At least I'll still have me
And if I don't have you
At least I'll still have me

I never thought twice
'Cause you were my number one
I put you first 'cause
You were my only thought

No more riding on the train
No more smoking in the alley
Now my secrets only stay with me
Everybody knows I'm upset
They don't even have to ask it
They know I believed in us last week

And if I don't have you
At least I'll still have me
And if I don't have you
At least I'll still have me

And there's no reason to speak badly
We just reached our end
I will see you in parts of me
In who I was back then

If I don't have you
At least I'll still have me
And if I don't have you
At least I'll still have me, me, me
