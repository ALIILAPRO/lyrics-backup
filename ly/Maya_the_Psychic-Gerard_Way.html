		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're not just dreamers,
We're the cannot comprehend
We gather up our forces
She's busy hearing voices again
Pneumonic-screamers came to gather up our friends
If giving in is pointless then get out of bed
Or this might be the end

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us more

You teenage believers, rallied up against the fence
Use weapons of clairvoyance
You adolescent strike-force against
Metallic deceivers
From a planet far away
But when you read my fortune are we running home
Or running free today?

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us more

Are you hearing voices again?
Are they with you, and are they giving you commands?
I know you've had choices to make

But I'm with you
You're never facing them alone today

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us more

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us more

Voices hearing you loud
We're taking the sound back with us
Now I'm hearing you loud
We're coming around
Just give us more
