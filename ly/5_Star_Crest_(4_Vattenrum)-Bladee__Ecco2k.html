		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nightmares find me, they strike like lightning
Blinding lights over the horizon
I look to the sky and it smiles back down on me
Am I missing something? (A dream of life)
Close my eyes and the sun stops shining
Close my eyes and the sky falls down on me
It all seems so real
Am I missing something?

Five star the crest
Love and respect will win again
The shields shining
Golden falcons flying in
Silver glowing, three-three's open
The castle sings, D-E-O-A
D-E-O-A, quest completion
Inspiratio heroine
I'm born again, no suffering

I am everything, Fountainhead from the Arrowhead
Under iron rain, rest my head under arrowheads
Everything, Fountainhead from the Arrowhead
Under iron rain, rest my head under arrowheads
Loss and gain
Oh, Gloria, oh, Gloria
Oh, Gloria, oh, Gloria

Gloria in excelsis, Deo, Deo (perfect)
Excelsior, we excel everything and anything
I was gone for a long time but I'm back again
Go 'round again, again for the perfect win
(Perfect)

Calm your thoughts, go with the flow, baby, believe in me
Be nothing but be with me, let's be heavenly

Gloria in excelsis, Deo, Deo
Excelsior, we excel everything and anything
I was gone for a long time but I'm back again
Go 'round again, again for the perfect win
(Perfect)

Ooh-oh, could it be?
That heaven is fleeting and always
And nothing is forever, and wishing will get you nowhere
Ooh-ooh, what a dream, go to sleep
And wake up tomorrow
Funny how I'm always on the head of the arrow (ooh-ooh)

Funny how I'm always on the head of the arrow (ooh-ooh)

Ooh-ooh, could it be?
That heaven is fleeting and always
And nothing is forever, and wishing will get you nowhere
Ooh-ooh, what a dream, go to sleep
And wake up tomorrow
Funny how I'm always on the head of the arrow (ooh-ooh)

(Ooh-ooh)

(Ooh-ooh)

Beauty is my drug, I'm the pusher, push it
We think we exist, that's why we suffer, do we not?
Sweet but treacherous is the poison, baby
Give it to me raw, death is beautiful

Death is beautiful
Give it to me raw, death is-death is beautiful
(Give it to me raw, death is-death is beautiful)

Death is beautiful, death is beautiful, death is beautiful
Death is beautiful, death is beautiful
We think we exist, that's why we suffer, do we not? (Do we not?)
Give it to me raw, death is-death is beautiful
Death is beautiful, death is beautiful, death is beautiful
Death is beautiful, death is beautiful
We think we exist, that's why we suffer, do we not? (Do we not?)
Give it to me raw, death is-death is beautiful

Beauty is my drug, I'm the pusher
We think we exist, that's why we suffer, do we not?
Sweet but treacherous is the poison, baby
Give it to me raw, death is beautiful

Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah
