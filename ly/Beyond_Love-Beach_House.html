		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beyond love
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals
From the rose that's in your mouth

Beyond love
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands

Beyond love
This man comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it

All I know's what I see 
No change in this
Visions born into dreams
Of a world left without it

We really wanna know
We really do agree
We really do agree
We really wanna know

The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light

We really wanna know
Beyond love
All I know's what I see 
And I can't live without this
Could you ever believe?
Beyond love

I really wanna know
I really wanna know
