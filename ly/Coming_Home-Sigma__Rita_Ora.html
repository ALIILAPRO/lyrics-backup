		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Knowing that I find it on my own
'Cause this life ain't leading the way I can go
I'm standing still with nothing in my way
Letting me go so I can find myself again

I need that (ground beneath my feet) to feel that
(Ground beneath my feet) I need that
(Ground beneath my feet) to feel that
(Ground beneath my feet) I need that
(Ground beneath my feet) to feel that
(Ground beneath my feet) I need that
(Ground beneath my feet) to feel that, I need that

I need that home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause it's life that I've been living in my home
Home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause I'm tired of being out here on my own
I'm coming home, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming home, oh yeah
And all of this time I've been living it up
All that's is left is rubble and dust
Oh-oh, I'm coming home

I know if I can find my own way back
There's a life I always knew but never had
I'm tired of fighting things that I can't change
Letting me go so I can finally find my place

I need that (ground beneath my feet) to feel that
(Ground beneath my feet) I need that
(Ground beneath my feet) to feel that
(Ground beneath my feet) I need that
(Ground beneath my feet) to feel that
(Ground beneath my feet) I need that
(Ground beneath my feet) to feel that, I need that

I need that home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause it's life that I've been living in my home
Home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
'Cause I'm tired of being out here on my own
I'm coming home, oh yeah yeah yeah
I'm coming home, oh yeah
And all of this time I've been living it up
All that's is left is rubble and dust
Oh-oh, I'm coming home
