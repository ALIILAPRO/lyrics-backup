		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
Just a little bit of love is worth a moment of your time
Knocking on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burning
Oh, I know I'll keep it burning right
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me
Won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh

This just might hurt a little
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you save, save

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me
Won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh

(Pa-ya-pa-pa)
(Pa-ya-pa-pa)
(Pa-ya-pa-pa)
(Da-da-da)

Oh, come on
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing 'til you try
I'll keep you satisfied
If you stay, won't you save, save

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me
Won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh

Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh
