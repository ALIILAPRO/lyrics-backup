		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many people get a taste of the spotlight
And then they off and gone
And they succumb to the evil
Run away from the people that they love
And oh, Lord i don't wanna be that
You can get me on track my Lord
Won't You keep me on track?
'Cause I don't want none of that, no no
'Cause I don't wanna be lost

Only You can keep me, God
('Cause I don't wanna be lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Lord, only You can keep me, God (Lost, lost)
Only You can keep me, God (Lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Only You can keep me, God
('Cause I don't wanna be lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Lord, only You can keep me, God (Lost, lost)
Only You can keep me, God (Lost)

And there's so many evils in this world
Who am I to escape? Am I that great?
But You said if I would trust
In You, I'll be alright
Yeah, I'll be just fine
So I come right to You
With not much I can give my heart is to You
That's all I can give the way that I live
And the way that I move may it all be
A pleasure to You

Only You can keep me, God
('Cause I don't wanna be lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Lord, only You can keep me, God (Lost, lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Only You can keep me, God
Only You can keep me, God
('Cause I don't wanna be lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Lord, only You can keep me, God (Lost, lost)
Only You can keep me, God

I surrender all in Your presence
I just want to be Yours
'cause You know me best
I will give my heart to forever
I just want to be found as Your friend
I surrender all in Your presence
I just want to be Yours
'cause You know me best
I will give my heart to forever
I just want to be found as Your friend

Only You can keep me, God
('Cause I don't wanna be lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Lord, only You can keep me, God (Lost, lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Only You can keep me, God
('Cause I don't wanna be lost)
Only You can keep me, God
Lord, only You can keep me, God (Lost, lost)
Only You can keep me, God
