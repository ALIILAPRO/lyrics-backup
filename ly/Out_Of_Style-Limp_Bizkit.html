		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We cannot change the past
But we can start today to make a better tomorrow

Hit it
DJ Lethal
Fresh
Fresh
Fresh (chiggity-check, three, two, one)

I've been askin' for somethin' (askin' for somethin')
While I'm askin' for nothin' (askin' for nothin')
When's it gonna change?
Hurts me in a loving kinda way
I'ma celebrate, yeah

It's time to rock this motherfucker 'cause I'm always out of style (style)
Never change my style 'cause my style is kinda fresh
You bitches askin' for a sound check, check, one, two, bitch
You barely touch the ground, yeah (woo)

Choked up on your bounce game, comin' down the mountain
Copycats, you lucky that I let you hang around me
Check, three, four, Bizkit out there on the bounty
In the warzone, got these campers all around me

We should be on the same team (same team)
On the motherfuckin' same team (same team)
If we ain't then we nothing, nothing (woo)

Damn, got serious for a second
I would say delirious, for the record
Lookin' back as a skeptic
Why is there a cross hangin' from my necklace?

When's it gonna change?
Hurts me in a, in a loving kinda way
I'ma celebrate, yeah

It's time to rock this motherfucker 'cause I'm always out of style (style)
Never change my style 'cause my style is kinda fresh
You bitches askin' for a sound check, check, one, two, bitch
You barely touch the ground, yeah (woo)

Choked up on your bounce game, comin' down the mountain
Copycats, you lucky that I let you hang around me
Check, three, four, Bizkit out there on the bounty
In the warzone, got these campers all around me

We should be on the same team (same team)
On the motherfuckin' same team (same team)
If we ain't then we nothing, nothing
(We should be on the same team)
(On the motherfuckin' same team)
(If we ain't then we nothing, nothing)

It's time to rock this motherfucker 'cause I'm always out of style (style)
Never change my style 'cause my style is kinda fresh
You bitches askin' for a sound check, check, one, two, bitch
You barely touch the ground, yeah (woo)

Choked up on your bounce game, comin' down the mountain
Copycats, you lucky that I let you hang around me
