		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn up the radio
And turn off the lights
I wanna ask for help
I want the words to melt
'Cause I've got to lose myself tonight
Yeah, I've got to let it all go tonight
So, turn off the lights

'Cause now the world's turn down - stop.
Frames all the "byes", and the "maybes" and the "mights"
And I should've known the hammer dropped
'Cause something must be wrong when everything is right

And nothing's gonna stop us now
Yeah, nothing's gonna stop us now

So turn up the radio
And turn off the lights
I wanna ask for help
I want the world to melt
'Cause I've got to lose myself tonight
Yeah, I've got to let it all go tonight
Yeah, I've got to let it all go tonight
So turn up the radio
And turn off the lights

You know it's always, it just shines
But everything is just right, everything is blue sky
But, how huge that divine
And the hungrier the ghost, the more it opens wide

And nothing's gonna stop us now
Yeah, nothing's gonna stop us now

So turn up the radio
And turn off the lights
I wanna ask for help
I want the world to melt
'Cause I've got to lose myself tonight
Yeah, I've got to let it all go tonight
Yeah, I've got to let it all go tonight
So turn up the radio
And turn off the lights

So, just tell me what's going on
So, just tell me what's going on
Going on, going on

Turn up the radio
And turn off the lights
I wanna ask for help
I want the words to melt
'Cause I got to lose myself tonight
Yeah, I got to let all go tonight
Yeah, I've got to lose myself tonight
Yeah, I've got to lose myself tonight
So, turn off the lights
Cause I've got to let it all go tonight
Yeah, I've got to lose myself tonight
So, turn off the lights
