		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is like candy on a shelf
You want to taste and help yourself
The sweetest things are there for you 
Help yourself take a few
That's what I want you to do

We're always told repeatedly 
The very best in life is free
And if you want to prove it's true
Baby, I'm telling you 
This is what you should do

Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms
Just say the word and they're yours
Just help yourself to the love in my heart
Your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world
Could never buy what I can give
Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms
And then let's really start to live

Alright, hahahaha, yeah

My heart has love enough for two 
More than enough for me and you 
I'm rich with love, a millionaire
I've so much, it's unfair
Why don't you take a share

Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms
Just say the word and they're yours
Just help yourself to the love in my heart
Your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world
Could never buy what I can give
So help yourself to my lips, to my arms
And then let's really start to live

Just help yourself to my lips, to my arms
Just say the word and they're yours
