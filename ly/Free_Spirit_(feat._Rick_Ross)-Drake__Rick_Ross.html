		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tat my name on you, girl, so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real

Tell a bad bitch girl, let's go hang
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck my young niggas, XO gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range, I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back, so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows 'n Screw flows, my shit be sounding like grey tapes, now
Lemme go an' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything that make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us, oh no

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let 'em know you love (yeah) the boy, wassup?

I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffin' purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching, and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold Rollie's
Mba accountants, amounts they get unholy
But mama still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'
Tap dance to my drum roll
I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let 'em know you love the boy, wassup? 

I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I give everybody a piece of this and I make due with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit 'til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you that it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real, wassup? (ayy)

Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let 'em know you love the boy, wassup?
