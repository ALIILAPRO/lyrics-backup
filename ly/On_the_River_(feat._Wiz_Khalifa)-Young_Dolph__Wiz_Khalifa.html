		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty white bitches sniffin' cocaine
My trap house live like the "Soul Train" yeah
I had a dream when I was a young nigga (me too)
Bad bitches
Young live money, big pound of weed in that motherfucker (hold up)
Gang gang, yeah

If she ain't pretty, she can't ride with me (hell no)
If she ain't got ass, I don't wanna smash (no thank you)
Weed so good, I don't wanna pass (whoooo)
All I smoke is killer (strong), your bitch look like "Thriller" (damn)
I might pull up and serve you a pound on a four-wheeler (skrrt)
Fuckin' with the realest, don't know a nigga realer (aye)
Yeah, I can show you how to make that money triple (work)
Took her out to eat, fucked her on the river (huh)

Syrup sipper, and she fuck with that liquor (yeah)
Took her out to eat, fucked her on the river (yeah)
She started with me first, pulling on my zipper (yeah)
She thick-ilicious, so you know I had to hit her
God damn, hell no, boy you know I didn't kiss her (no)
I'm from Memphis, you know I thought about pimping (yup)
G's up hoes down
I might break a bitch like I break down a pound
Want the work for cheap, jump on a plane go out of town
Yeah you see that boy solid, make that pussy stay from round
All I wanna do is count money, lay up with my lil' bitch
Rich niggas ain't dumb, dumb niggas ain't rich

If she ain't pretty, she can't ride with me (hell no)
If she ain't got ass, I don't wanna smash (no thank you)
Weed so good, I don't wanna pass (whoooo)
All I smoke is killer (strong), your bitch look like "Thriller" (damn)
I might pull up and serve you a pound on a four-wheeler (skrrt)
Fuckin' with the realest, don't know a nigga realer (aye)
Yeah, I can show you how to make that money triple (work)
Took her out to eat, fucked her on the river (huh)

All I smoke is killer, gotta shout out Killer
See me in the club, I be standing next to killers
Got a crib in Cali so my car ain't got no ceilings
Smellin' like that KK when I walk into the building
Thankful, tryna get another million
Get jammed up, he gon' sing like Bryson Tiller
Garage look like the dealer
Got 'em look familiar
Plus I rep them Stealers
Don't care what the bill is
Buy it all, buy it all, buy it all
I met the bitch, on the first night she gon' try it all
Lie for bad for a nigga cause he keep tryna call
Got a Rover at my crib, she'll be back to you tomorrow

If she ain't pretty, she can't ride with me (hell no)
If she ain't got ass, I don't wanna smash (no thank you)
Weed so good, I don't wanna pass (whoooo)
All I smoke is killer (strong), your bitch look like "Thriller" (damn)
I might pull up and serve you a pound on a four-wheeler (skrrt)
Fuckin' with the realest, don't know a nigga realer (aye)
Yeah, I can show you how to make that money triple (work)
Took her out to eat, fucked her on the river (huh)
