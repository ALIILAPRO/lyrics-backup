		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Vanitas vanitatum  I was born to pave the way To let the masses hear listen to my say They'll follow through the darkest nights As to a shepherd with second sight  But I'm a simple man I follow God's own plan Only a few coins in my hands I live alone The only life I've known I do not need nor want this throne on no...  Upon this stage these words I sing Peace to all men is the dream I wish to bring yeah... So do as I do not as I say Out of this ocean land I cannot lead the way  For I'm a simple man I follow God's own plan I dance while raising high both hands I'll preach tonight These few words of light But I swear I'm not Jesus Christ  Minor sum cunctis miserationibus quam explesti servo tuo""
