		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not alive until you start kicking
When the room is spinning and the words ain't sticking

And the radio is all about a run away model 
With a face like sin and a heart like a James Joyce novel

Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist and take the skin off of my blister"
If you're a Rock Star, Porn Star, Superstar
Doesn't matter what you are, get yourself a good car, get outta here

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

Driver's got names to fill two double barrels
He spits out "Brits out" only smokes Carrolls
And he's refreshing the world in mind body and spirit
Mind body and spirit
You better hear it and fear it
Oh thats the spirit

Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya 
Let's go wrist to wrist, and take the skin off of my blister"
If you're a Rock Star, Porn Star, Superstar
Doesn't matter what you are, get yourself a good car, get outta here

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

Driver's got names to fill two double barrels
He spits out "Brits out" only smokes Carrolls
And he's refreshing the world in mind body and spirit
Mind body and spirit
You better hear it and fear it
Oh thats the spirit

Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya 
Let's go wrist to wrist, and take the skin off of my blister"
If you're a Rock Star, Porn Star, Superstar
Doesn't matter what you are, get yourself a good car, get outta here

But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout those boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
