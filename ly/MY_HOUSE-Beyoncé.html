		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go

Oh, who they came to see? Me
Who rep like me? Don't make me get up out my seat
Uh, oh
Uh, oh
Who let my goons out that house? Uh, huh, who?
Who let my goons out that house? Uh, uh, who?
Oh, oh
Who let my goons out that house? Uh, uh, who?
Who out there talkin' all that mouth? Uh, uh, who?

Me and my thug bae gon' slide tonight (slide tonight)
Call the paparazzi, ain't got clips to hide tonight (boom, pow)
Cash out this pain, call Lorraine (Schwartz)
Then take me to Tiffany, I want forty-four karats on my fangs (bling, ah)
I want pink diamonds on my belly chain and my nipple rings (grrah)
I'm grabbin' grain, sippin' sideways on this candy paint (damn, damn)
I'm done savin' this money, tonight we gon' ball out (we gon' ball out)
You can catch me highsidin', drinkin' brown liquor 'til I fall out ('til fall out)
Playa, who let these goons out the house? Huh, huh, who?
Who out there talkin' all that mouth? Huh, huh, who?
Who they came to see? Me
Who reppin' like me?
Don't make me get up out of my seat
Don't make me come up off of this beat, huh

Oh (uh, oh, watch out, watch out, watch out)
Oh-oh-oh (uh, oh, watch out, watch out, watch out)
Oh-oh-oh (uh, uh-uh-uh)
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Who let my goons out of that house? Uh, uh, who?
Who let my goons out of that house? Uh, uh, who?
Oh
I'm hearin' whispers (oh), -ers
Who let my goons out of that house? Uh, uh, who? (Whoa)
Who out there talkin' out their mouth? Uh, uh, who? (Whoa)
Oh (ooh, ah)

(House, house)
Yeah
(House, house)

When I grow up, I'm gon' buy me a (house)
Make love in the (house)
Stay up late in this (house)
Don't give a fuck about my (house)
Then get the fuck up out of my house
Get the fuck up out my house
Get the fuck up out my house
Get the fuck up out my house
Get the fuck up out my house
I grew up in this (house)
I blew up in this (house)
I'm too up in this (house)
Don't give a fuck about my (house)
Then get the fuck up out of my (house)
Get the fuck up out my (house)
Get the fuck up out my (house)
Get the fuck up out my (house)

I will always love you (ooh, house, house)
But I'll never expect you to love me (ooh, house, house)
When you don't love yourself (ooh, house, house)
Let's heal the world (ooh, house, house)
One beautiful action at a time (ooh, house, house)
This is real love
Lend your soul to intuitions (this is real)
RENAISSANCE, new revolution
Pick me up even if I fall
Let love heal us all, us all, us all
Don't make me get up out my seat
Don't make me get up out my seat (carry)
Don't make me get up out my seat (carry)
Don't make me get up out my seat (I carry)
(Who they came to see? Me) I carry
(Who they came to see? Me) I carry
(Who they came to see? Me) I carry
(Who they came to see? Me) bitch, I carry

When I grow up, I'm gon' buy me a (house)
Make love in the (house)
Stay up late in this (house)
Don't give a fuck about my (house)
Then get the fuck up out my (house)
Get the fuck up out of my (house)
Get the fuck up out my (house)
Get the fuck up out my (house)
Get the fuck up out my house
I grew up in this house
I blew up in this house
I'm too up in this house
Don't give a fuck about my house
Then get the fuck up out my house
Get the fuck up out my house
Get the fuck up out my house
Get the fuck up out my house

Lend your soul to intuitions
RENAISSANCE, new revolution
Pick me up even if I fall
Let love heal us all, us all, us all
