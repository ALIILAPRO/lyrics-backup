		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When your heart gives out and your love collapses
When the hand that never lets go is there no more
When you reap and sow only throe and resentment
When there's no one else but you to blame for

When all you ever wish for is to go back once more
When all you ever wish for is to change it all
When all you feel is remorse, pain and regret
When you dwell in the past, unable to move on

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Build a wall of glass thick and deep
We hear but choose not to listen

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Set all the bridges in flaming fire
Leave all the love we had behind

When you realize that your life is a one-way road
When you realize that there's no point of return
When you understand that you can't go back anymore
When you understand you can only move onwards

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Build a wall of glass thick and deep
We hear but choose not to listen

And we drift far away in our dreams
Gather further distance while we sleep
Set all the bridges in flaming fire
Leave all the love we had behind

Slow down
We need to slow down
We need to slow down so I can catch you

We need to slow down so I can catch you
We need to slow down so you can catch me
We need to slow down so I can catch you
We need to slow down so you can catch me
Slow down
