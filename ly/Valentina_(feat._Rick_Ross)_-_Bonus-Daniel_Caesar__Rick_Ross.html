		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine

I know it's late, and I know you got a man 
Please understand, baby, he won't (baby, he won't)
Love you like I do (like I do)
Give me a break, I know that you want me too (give me a break)
Your loyal is cool, I understand 
And I respect it

Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time (moment of time)
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine (it's the biggest)
(The feelings for you are so real, baby)
(I like this, babe- I like this, babe- I like this, babe)

Fantasize, got you caught up in this life of mine
Fast money, think it's time to quit your nine to five
Slow kiss, hold your hand, let's walk along the beach
Never lost, you know the boss, I'm rising on the East
Makin' love like it's war when it's really peace
I just wanna make you smile, can I see your teeth? (Ha-ha-ha)
I know you need a king, I believe it's me
Let's fall in love, I make your enemy my enemy
Fell in love with your emotion and the way you think
I need for you to really teach me all your favorite things
Calabasas and slow kisses at the fireplace
All the madness might just make me wanna fly away
All of that, I take her home, and then I'll call her back
Diamond rings, smaller things, can I massage your back?
Can you handle it? I kept a candle lit
A nigga came to kill again, I'll call an ambulance

Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine
