		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I scratch and then you pry 
Yeah we're getting off on eachother's lies 
Come on, I know just what you hide 
Yet I'm in your claws every single night 

Rhythm and writhing 
Trust and defying 
Let you toxify me 
Cause you can't deny me 

God I'm still on such a high 
You're bad and you're mine 
And I'll have you while you're here 
Let my fantasies unwind 

God I'm still on such a high 
You're bad and you're mine 
And I'll have you while you're here 
Let my fantasies unwind 

Relax and then unwind 
Ya we come together into the night 
Under cold darkened skies 
Feeling around for tears that have run dry 

Rhythm and writhing 
Trust and defying 
Let you toxify me 
Cause you can't deny me 

God I'm still on such a high 
You're bad and you're mine 
And I'll have you while you're here 
Let my fantasies unwind 

God I'm still on such a high 
You're bad and you're mine 
And I'll have you while you're here 
Let my fantasies unwind
