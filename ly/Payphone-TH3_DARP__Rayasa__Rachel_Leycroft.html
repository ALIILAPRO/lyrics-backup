		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse1:
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down


Pre-Chorus:
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise


Post-Chorus:
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
And I'm at a payphone


Pre-Chorus:
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down


Chorus:
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise


Outro:
Now baby don't hang up, 
So I can tell you what you need to know
Baby I'm begging you just please don't go,
So I can tell you what you need to know
Ooh Oo
