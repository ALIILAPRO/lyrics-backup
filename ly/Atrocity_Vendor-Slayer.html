		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're staring at the atrocity vendor
A fucking equal-opportunity offender
Surge of power to [?] to control
For your own terror, watch the seeds of death unfold

I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you
Light you up with kerosene, watch you burn, watch you bleed
I am torture redefined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
Violence pulse in my veins, death forever reigns

In this chapel, I'm the master
A fucking guarantee of your impending disaster
No limit to the anguish you'll see
Bear witness to this agony, [?]

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you
Reeking of despair, this is no fucking nightmare
I am torture redefined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
Violence pulses in my veins, death forever reigns

You're staring at the atrocity vendor
Motherfucking equal opportunity offender
So many parts of you, I'll possess
Jokers [?] your mind to obsess

I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you
First-class terror, personal genocide
I am evil unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels

Violence pulses in my veins, death forever reigns
