La la da da da da, la da da

I was gonna clean my room until I got high
I was gonna get up and find the broom but then I got high
My room is still messed up and I know why (why, man?)
Yeah, hey
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

La da da da da da da

I was gonna go to class before I got high (come on, y'all)
(Check it out)
I coulda cheated and I coulda passed but I got high
I am taking it next semester and I know why (why, man?)
Yeah, hey
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

(Go to the next one, go to the next one, go to the next one)

I was gonna go to court before I got high
I was gonna pay my child support but then I got high (no, you wasn't)
They took my whole paycheck and I know why (why, man?)
Yeah, hey
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

La da da da da da

I wasn't gonna run from the cops but I was high
(I'm serious, man)
I was gonna pull right over and stop but I was high
Now I am a paraplegic, and I know why (why, man?)
Yeah, hey
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

La da da da da da

I was gonna make love to you but then I got high
I was gonna eat yo pussy, too, but then I got high
Now I'm jacking off and I know why (turn this shit off)
Yeah, hey
'Cause I got high (keep going)
Because I got high (ayy, do that over again)
Because I got high (come on, man, come on)

La da da da da da

I messed up my entire life because I got high
I lost my kids and wife because I got high (say what, say what, say what, say what)
Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk and I know why (why, man?)
Yeah, hey
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

La da da da da da

I'ma stop singing this song because I'm high (present tense, baby, oh)
I'm singing this whole thing wrong because I'm high (bring it back, bring it back)
And if I don't sell one copy I'll know why (why, man?)
'Cause I'm high
'Cause I'm high
'Cause I'm high (are you really high though, man?)
