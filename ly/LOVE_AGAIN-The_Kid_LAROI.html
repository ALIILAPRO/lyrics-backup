		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we go back to how it was?
Before my pride got in between us
Go ahead and hit me where it hurts
Because at least then I'll feel something

Screaming in my face
Kicked me out your place
I got nowhere to go

Can we find love again?
Is this time the end?
Tell me, how many more tears will drop
'Til you hit me with, "Can we talk?"
And try love again
Can we find love again?
Is this time the end?
Tell me, how many more tears will drop
'Til you hit me with, "Can we talk?"
And try love again

I crashed my car into a wall
I tried to text, I shoulda called
Seen blue and red, it won't be long (ooh, uh)
Uh, we went to war, it didn't end
I bit my tongue, you hit my chin
Worst enemy is my best friend (ooh)

Screaming in my face
Kicked me out your place
I got nowhere to go

Can we find love again?
Is this time the end?
Tell me, how many more tears will drop
'Til you hit me with, "Can we talk?"
And try love again
Can we find love again?
Is this time the end?
Tell me, how many more tears will drop
'Til you hit me with, "Can we talk?"
And try love again
