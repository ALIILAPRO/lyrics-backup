		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're always there to listen
You always put me first
When nobody else gets it
It's us against the world

Sometimes you know me better than I know myself
And when I'm down I always reach to you for help
And I don't say it often
But without you I'm not much

I see me when I'm looking at you
We both know all the things we've been through
When you cry you know I feel it too but
When you smile, I smile

There is something that connects us
We've always felt it there
Ain't no one I love better
There's no one who compares

Sometimes you know me better than I know myself
And when I'm down I always reach to you for help
And I don't say it often
But without you I'm not much (woo)

I see me when I'm looking at you
We both know all the things we've been through
When you cry you know I feel it too but
When you smile, I smile

Yeah, know with me you'll never be alone
Know with me you'll always have a home, yeah
When you cry you know I feel it too but
When you smile, I smile

(You smile) I smile
(You smile) I smile

I see me when I'm looking at you
We both know all the things we've been through
When you cry you know I feel it too but
When you smile, I smile

Yeah, know with me you'll never be alone
Know with me you'll always have a home, yeah
When you cry you know I feel it too but
When you smile, I smile

I smile

Know with me you'll never be alone
Know with me you'll always have a home
When you smile, I smile
