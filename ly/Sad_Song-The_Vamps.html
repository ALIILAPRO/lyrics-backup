		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many nights, so many days
Through all of the fights, 'cause I never behaved
And I'm putting it right, hope it isn't too late
And I know, you know, I know we can't let it end this way

Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
And the one thing that I regret is
I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
Yeah you're still running through my head

So hold on, baby
Know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
She could make me happy, oh
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
She used to make me happy

She used to make me happy
Missing nights, staying up late 
Scratches and bites, you screamin' my name
Is he loving you right, am I too late?
'Cause I know, you know, I know we can't let it end this way

Though I stopped calling you
And I stopped taking your messages
Never stopped loving you
You're still running through my head

So hold on, baby
Know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
She could make me happy, oh
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
She used to make me happy

She used to make me happy
She used to make me happy
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
She could make me happy

Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby 

Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby 

So hold on, baby
Know you drive me crazy
It's a sad song really
She could make me happy, oh
Ain't always cool
But it's alright
It's not a sad song really
She used to make me happy

Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, baby
Hold on, hold on
It's not a sad song, sad song, yeah
Hold on, hold on
She used to make me happy
