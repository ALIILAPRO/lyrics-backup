		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I thought I was dreaming
'Cause things like you don't usually happen to me
Outside, the stars were the ceiling
We sang to the moon then we danced underneath

I fell so hard but you kissed so soft
I felt my heart couldn't beat enough
You pulled me closer and called my bluff
I am in love, I am enough

Sleeping in on Sunday morning, I am
Lying next to you
Darling, if we're falling sparks we'll fly and
Ignite the fuse
(Like dynamite)

We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red
(In the sky)
Love is unfolding before our eyes and lighting the way ahead
(Like fireflies)
This is a memory in our minds that we will never forget
(You and I)
We are the love and we are the night
We are, dynamite

First love with a reason
Darling, hold my hand and take my heart
Say you love me once more with a feeling
And kiss me slow in the back of the car

I drop my guard, let you in
This love is ours, it's everything
And we both know, it's simple stuff
We are in love, we are enough

Sleeping in on Monday morning, I am
Lying next to you
And darling, if we're falling sparks we'll fly and
Ignite the fuse
(Like dynamite)

We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red
(In the sky)
Love is unfolding before our eyes and lighting the way ahead
(Like fireflies)
This is a memory in our minds that we will never forget
(You and I)
We are the love and we are the night
We are, dynamite

We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red

We are exploding colours that shining purple and green and red
(In the sky)
Love is unfolding before our eyes and lighting the way ahead
(Like fireflies)
This is a memory in our minds that we will never forget
(You and I)
We are the love and we are the night
We are, dynamite
