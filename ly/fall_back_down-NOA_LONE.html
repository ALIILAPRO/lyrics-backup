		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the heaven sets on fire
Some needs to remind her
The world is full of wonders
She lost control of her own

Her dreams have been better
She needs to get back there
The grass won’t get greener
Cause there is no other side

She stands and falls back down
Cause there is someone who steals her crown
She stands and falls back down
Now she’s not who she was
Not who she was
And still she tries to put herself back together
And find a way to fly
She’ll fall back down
Cause there is someone who steals her crown
Who steals her

As her soul is getting colder
Somebody needs to hold her
Cause she is going under
All on her own

Her dreams are kinda bitter
And it doesn’t suit her
The grass won’t get greener
Cause there’s no other side

She stands and falls back down
Cause there is someone who steals her crown
She stands and falls back down
Now she’s not who she was
Not who she was
And still she tries to put herself back together
And find a way to fly
She’ll fall back down
Cause there is someone who steals her crown
Who steals her

She keep´s on trying to fly
She keep´s on trying, on trying
Not to fall back down


She stands and falls back down
Cause there is someone who steals her crown
She stands and falls back down
Now she’s not who she was
Not who she was
And still she tries to put herself back together
And find a way to fly
She’ll fall back down
Cause there is someone who steals her crown
Who steals her
