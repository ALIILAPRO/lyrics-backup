		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd give anything to wrap you in my arms
Hold you after all is said and done
Try my best to keep you safe from harm
I just want for you to know my love
I'd give anything to wrap you in my arms
Hold you after all is said and done
Try my best to keep you safe from harm
I just want for you to know my love

To know my love
To know my love
To know my love
I just want for you to know my love
To know my love
I just want for you to know my love
To know my love

I'd give anything to wrap you in my arms
Hold you after all is said and done
Try my best to keep you safe from harm
I just want for you to know my love
I'd give anything to wrap you in my arms
Hold you after all is said and done
Try my best to keep you safe from harm
I just want for you to know my love
 
To know my love
To know my love
To know my love
To know my love
To know my love

To know my love
To know my love
I just want for you to know my love
To know my love
I just want for you to know my love
