		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wri-, he from the Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca-Ca

Did I really just forget that melody?
Da, da da-da-da-da

When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, "Lalalala, lalala"
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, "Lalalala, lalala"
How I stride like that

Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how (how I guap like that)
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how (how I stride like that)

Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my than-than-than-thanks (hey)

Da, da da-da-da-da, ha, ayy
Da, da da-da-da-da
Da, da da-da-da-da, ha, ayy
Da, da da-da-da-da
How I stride like that

Haha, I'm at the bank again
They wonder how (how I guap like that)
Pink whip with flames all on the side
They wonder how (how I stride like that)

Got that Gucci on my body, now she tryna pipe me, woo
Popped a Lucy, loosey-goosey, sussy boy, I keep you cool
Got the paper, went to school
Be careful who you callin' fool, ayy, ha, ayy

When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, "Lalalala, lalala"
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, "Lalalala, lalala"
How I stride like that?
