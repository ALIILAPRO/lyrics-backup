		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Someone like you, someone like you)
Love

Say that you want to feel
Say that you want me near to you
Say that we will grow up
Together, and not apart

I'll always need someone like you
To surround me with the sunshine that follows you

We've been here so many times
Walked all the mountains (walked all the mountains)
Dipped in the streams (dipped in the streams)
And sometimes I've floated along
Sometimes I've drowned
And it's so scary, I can't forget

I'll always need someone like you
To surround me with the sunshine that follows you

What if I only remember the good times?
Would I be lying to myself?
What if I denied that you ever hurt me?
Would I be true to myself?
Is that what you want from me?
Is that what you want from me?

There's never been no one like you
There's never been no one like you
There's never been no one like you
There's never been no one like you
There's never been (there's never been)
No one like you (no one like you, like you)
There's never been (there's never been)
No one like you (no one like you)
There's never been (there's never been)
No one like you (no one like you, like you)
There's never been (there's never been)
No one like you (no one like you, like you)
There's never been (there's never been)
No one like you (no one like you, like you)
There's never been (there's never been)
No one like you (no one like you, like you)
(There's never been no one like you, like you)
(Like you)
