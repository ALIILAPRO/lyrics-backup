		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are not afraid of trash films and boredom
We are not afraid of trash films and boredom

Oh, I'm in love with your cat
Though she would never care
And you would never guess
I felt so delighted when I
Saw the green circle
Around your story you boost my ego

We are not afraid of trash films and boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom
We don't want to hear no more moral lectures
Lectures, lectures, lectures

Oh, sun's had enough enemies
Cops are selling me crack
Give us home remedies
All you ever wanted was to be a Rockstar
Sell me, sell me joy and boost your ego

We are not afraid of trash films and boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom
We don't want to hear no more moral lectures
Lectures, lectures, lectures

We are not afraid of trash films and boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom
We don't want to hear no more moral lectures
Lectures, lectures, lectures
