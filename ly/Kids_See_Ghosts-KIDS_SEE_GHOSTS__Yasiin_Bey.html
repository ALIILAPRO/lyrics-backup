		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, moving around, just moving around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah that's the king

Stop that movement, stop that movement
Y'all can't move me, this my movie
Y'all can't stop me, ya'll too sloppy
Carbon copied, carbon
Same thing, in a room
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out huntin' for the truth
I guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'
All this time searching hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'

Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, moving around, just moving around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah that's the king

Well it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up
'Cause Ye just gon' live up to everything
That sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever 'lieve nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin' 'cause yes I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than 
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say "Damn, you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it but, damn, now you hella known
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on"
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on?
I won't relish on the fact vibing on the future
Ultralight building in the building by Miuccia
Herzog and De Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (ahahaha)

Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, moving around, just moving around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah that's the king

Civilization, without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability, without stasis
Places and spaces
Civilization, without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability, without stasis
Spaces and places

Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts, ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Yeah that's the king
And what's a crown for the clouds, movin' around
Yeah that's the king
And what's a crown to the clouds, movin' around
