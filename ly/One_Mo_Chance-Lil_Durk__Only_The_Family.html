		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

It's like every time I talk they listen
You know what I'm sayin'

Lemme tell you a story
It started when I was a shorty
I went to school on the daily
And I was toting my .40

My homie got pounds on pounds (pounds)
I go his krill like a forest
Ask can you put me on now (now)
Like why you ignore me?

I tell 'em go pull up a Taurus
At the top shooting the tourists
I mix up a eight then I pour it
I left my feelings and story

Remember I jump off the porches
You ain't no killer ain't torturer
Don't get caught in the morning
We catch you then we scorin'

Wash that blow with chlorine
Say I'm a ho, you don't know me
How could you touch me, no cheese
Gotta watch out 'cause I'm lowkey

Niggas be cool with the police
I made a dub off 4 P's
I made a tribe with 4 piece
I went and copped me a Rollie

I done show love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again
Just give me your hand
To make my friends
Ya'll my friends

Give me a chance, give me a chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance

Man I thought you was my dog but you trickin'
You try to play me close but niggas know you out to get me
Shoulda known when I said nah, you cut me off
That shit was fishy
I trust you with my secrets but you went and told my business

Wanna be on the Forbes with you
I just slept on the floors with you
I done went to war with you
And we had no pistols

I told you stories when we both was hurting
When I was broke I was splitting the Percs
When I went broke I sold my thirty
Could've gone bad, and that shit hurt me

Caught with a gun, that shit was jerkin
Caught for murder , they ain't showin' no mercy
Snake yo blood, that shit ain't worth it
At the same time they know I'm perfect

Went on to hit, that nigga was nervous
But I was blind 'cause nigga too thirsty
Caught me a body I built with my courage
Better watch out cause my dog was informant

I done show love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again
Just give me your hand
To make my friends
Ya'll my friends

Give me a chance, give me a chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
