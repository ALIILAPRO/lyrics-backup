		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm somewhere in Brooklyn
Think what could've been
What city you in? (Oh)
I don't wanna call you
Then I wanna call you
I miss the old you (oh)
I think of a message to send
My phone is at seven percent
But when I go to try to reach you
I never can get through

I was the problem
Self sabotaging
You had no option (oh)
You had to go
When you had to go
And I couldn't stop it (oh)
I was not willing to bend
You said it again and again
You need a heart that better fits you

So you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow's side
You changed your number
And got some friends
That I don't recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try?
If I change
Would you change your mind?

Emotionally stranded
Left you abandoned
Took you for granted (oh)
And I should've listened
Showed my commitment
When you said we're drifting (oh)
If we could live in reverse
I'd go to the part where it hurt
I'd go and fix the little issues
Before they got too big
Is this all your way to try to not remember me? (Oh)
A beautiful disguise, so you're not who you were with me? (Oh)
But I think I know you so well
Enough that I think I could tell
Are you afraid to say you miss me?

'Cause you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow's side
You changed your number
And got some friends
That I don't recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try?
If I change
Would you change your mind? (Oh yeah, oh)
Change your mind, mmm

Yeah, you changed your world
You changed your hair
And the clothes you wear
And your pillow's side
You changed your number
And got some friends
That I don't recognize
But I wonder sometimes
Is it too late to try?
If I change
Would you change your mind?
Oh, whoa
Mmm, would you change your mind?
Only sometimes
