		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gaze into her killing jar
I'd sometimes stare for hours
She even poked the holes so I can breathe

She bought the last line
I'm just the worst kind of guy to argue
With what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Lost in the prescription
She's got something else in mind
Check into the hotel Bella Muerte

It gives the weak flight
It gives the blind sight
Until the cops come or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
And holding on
Well, I hope you do the same
Awww sugar
Slip into this tragedy
You've spun this chamber dry

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Alright, give up, get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
And holding on
Well, I hope you do the same
Awww sugar
