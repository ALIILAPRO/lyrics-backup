		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I must just be a lucky man
I didn't see it but I understand
Oh, it took some time but here I am
Sometimes stars align
I'm not the kind to make it easy
If I say the wrong things, I don't mean it
Don't lose faith, please, stand by me
'Cause sometimes stars align

Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
No matter where we land
We'll land there together
Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
'Cause you know when you know
So I won't let you go no where

I'm all for blinds and keeping promises
I'm all for lovin' if it feels like this
Oh, we took some time but I made that wish
Sometimes stars align

Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
No matter where we land
We'll land there together
Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
'Cause you know when you know
So I won't let you go no where

Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
No matter where we land
We'll land there together
Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
'Cause you know when you know
So I won't let you go no where

Wherever it leads, let's go there 
You and me could be something 
Wherever it leads, let's go there 
'Cause you know when you know
So I won't let you go no where

Can I hold your hand
And crown your love forever?
No matter where we land (no matter where)
We'll land there together (we'll land)
Can I hold your hand (can I? Can I?)
And crown your love forever?
'Cause you know when you know
So I won't let you go no where

Can I hold your hand (can I hold your hand?)
And crown your love forever?
No matter where we land (oh-oh-oh)
We'll land there together (we'll land there)
Can I hold your hand (can I hold your hand?)
And crown your love forever?
'Cause you know when you know
So I won't let you go no where
