		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what people think of me
I know what people think of me
All the boys in my cupboard
Have lost their heads
All the hottest Russian imports
I don't treat them like I should
I live for corruption

I know what people think of me
I know what people think of me
I'm the No1 Mafioso in the darkest suit
All the guns in my pockets
And everywhere I go i'm just messing around
I know what people think of me
I know what people think of me
All the boys that I did in their cowboy boots
All the fourteen year old pupils
I don't treat them like I should
Without interruption ohne Unterbrechung

I know what people think of me
I don't care what people think of me
I'm in the top 5 sexkillers of 2010
I'm alone and I'm proud and everywhere I go
I'm just doing my job
