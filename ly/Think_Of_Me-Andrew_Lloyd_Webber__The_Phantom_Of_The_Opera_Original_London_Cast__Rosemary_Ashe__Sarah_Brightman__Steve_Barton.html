		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in awhile
Please promise me you'll try

When you find, that once again you long
To take your heart 

He's here, the Phantom of the Opera!
He is with us
It's the ghost

He's here, the Phantom of the Opera!
He's with us, he's a ghost!

Good heavens!
Will you show a little courtesy?

Mademoiselle, please!

These things do happen

Si! These things do happen! Well, until you stop these things happening
This thing does not happen!

Christine Daa√© could sing it, sir

The chorus girl?

Let her sing for you, Monsieur 
She has been well taught

Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in awhile
Please promise me you'll try

When you find, that once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was ever green
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the things which might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking, silent and resigned
Imagine me trying too hard to put you from my mind

Recall those days
Look ack on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you

Can it be?
Can it be Christine?

Bravo!

What a change!
You're really not a bit the gawkish girl that once you were
She may not remember me
But I remember her

We never said our love was ever green
Or as unchanging as the sea
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think 
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Of me
