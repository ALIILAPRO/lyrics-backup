		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young love thought it wasn't a phase
We were so broke, working minimum wage
I know your momma had enough of me, I wasn't a saint
Sneaking out the bathroom window at a quarter to eight
We were growing up in a small-town life
Thought we'd be 18 for the rest of our lives
Maybe settle down and I'd make you my wife
And then everything changed in the blink of an eye
It's hard when you face the truth inside and out
So don't go on blaming yourself
Oh-woah-woah, no, no, no
Baby I know this might sound crazy
When I drive by your place lately
The lights keep coming on
Why th–µ lights keep coming on?
Oh yeah, been six months since I saw ya
And I know we're moving on, yeah
The lights keep coming on
Why the lights keep coming on?
Yeah, the lights keep coming on
Yeah, the lights keep coming on
Why the lights keep coming on?
So close, I remember the days
When we and bought a couch, and we got our new place
We were sleeping on the floor 'cause we both couldn't wait
It was straight out of a movie with the look on your face
Then we fast-forward a year and a month
When the pain got deep and it started to cut
Tell me, how'd it come to this when it started as love?
Yeah, I knew I couldn't stay 'cause it wasn't enough for you
It's hard when you face the truth inside and out
So don't go on blaming yourself
Oh-woah-woah, no, no, no
Baby I know this might sound crazy
When I drive by your place lately
The lights keep coming on
Why the lights keep coming on?
Oh yeah, been six months since I saw ya
And I know we're moving on, yeah
The lights keep coming on
Why the lights keep coming on?
Moving on, I thought it'd break me
Everything I lost
Baby
I know how it might sound
(Mmh, mmh, mmh)
Baby, I know this might sound crazy
When I drive by your place lately
The lights keep coming on
Why the lights keep coming on?
Oh yeah, been six months since I saw ya
And I know we're moving on, yeah
The lights keep coming on
Why the lights keep coming on?
Why the lights keep coming on?
