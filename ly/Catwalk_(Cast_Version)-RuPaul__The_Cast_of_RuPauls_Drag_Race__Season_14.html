		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause when we live in the light
We taste the sweet life
So walk how you feel like

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
I did show some skin
Don't fight (shh), give in
You can call me greedy, I feel that
The whole world, I need that
So ass out and horns up (ass out and horns up)

Check, from the country to the silver screen
It's Angie bitch, livin' out my dreams
I was always taught to walk with grace
Confidence, poise and tons of face
I've never been afraid to live out loud
I just wanted to make my daddy proud
And at the end of the day, I'ma always slay
Never let a bitch take my shine away

Hit 'em with your catwalk
Everywhere you go, everybody knows
You're somebody, the way you work that body
Hit 'em with your catwalk (everywhere you go)
Everywhere you go today (everybody knows)
You're somebody, the way you
Like the world is your runway

You see me stomp the floor, left to right
Walk the runway with my heels sky high
Now take the picture, catch the light
Clawed my way to the top, now I'm taking what's mine
So I strut to the beat, and even if I fall
I shove a safety pin through it and I stand real tall
Yeah, the mug is stamped and my waist is thinner
So you Betty be ready 'cause I've always been a winner

L to the A to the D to the Y
Like a shooting star, straight to the sky
Gonna make you snap, gonna make you say
Step, smack, a pas de bourr√©e 
Twist, turn, levitate
Act, pose, captivate
When I hit that stage, I'ma drive you crazy
Serve it to you like a Lady

Mmm, take a willow pill
Do my sick bitch looks have you feeling ill?
Kick it up to the top, 'cause I came to kill
And kick it back in my dream when I like to chill
Cute, absurd and a touch of ugly
I celebrate life, let's pour the bubbly
We live in a matrix, I'm the solution
Get lost in my sauce 'cause it's all an illusion

Hit 'em with your catwalk
Everywhere you go, everybody knows
You're somebody, the way you work that body
Hit 'em with your catwalk (everywhere you go)
Everywhere you go today (everybody knows)
You're somebody, the way you
Like the world is your runway

Catwalk
Hit 'em with your catwalk
Everywhere you go today
Like the world is your runway
Catwalk
