		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So forget the risk and leave it all behind
Fall in love, fall in lie
So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie

This is how it goes, not complicated
Want you tonight, like uh, uh
Going with the flow, I can't seem to stop this
Scared to let you go, like uh, uh

All I need is my self control
But you make me wanna lose it all
Believe in everything you say
I don't wanna leave this way

So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie
So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie

So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie
So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie

Promises we break, love can get tainted
Whispers in my ear be like uh, uh
You could take me there, every second we can get
A sweet love affair like uh, uh

All I need is my self-control
But you make me wanna lose it all
Believe in everything you say
I don't wanna leave this way

So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie
So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie

So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie
So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie

Fall in love, fall in lie
Fall in love or fall in lie
Fall in love, fall in lie
Fall in love or fall in lie

So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie
So forget the risk and leave it all behind
We can fall in love or we can fall in lie
