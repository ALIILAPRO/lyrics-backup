		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screaming my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up with you

I love it when we make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Go ahead, ruin my make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Love it when we make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Go ahead, ruin my make up (yeah, hey, hey)

My energy and attitude don't really coincide
I'm staying mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box, so when it pops, surprise surprise 

I love it when we make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Go ahead, ruin my make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Love it when we make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Go ahead, ruin my make up (yeah, hey, hey)

Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That's the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit

I love it when we make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Go ahead, ruin my make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Love it when we make up (yeah, hey, hey)
Go ahead, ruin my make up (yeah, hey, hey)

Let me stay in my bag 'cause I like when you mad
It's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look, it's a match
Attitude, dream of mine (Dream of mine)
When you say that I'm right (That I'm right)
And I find that it works every time

And I love it when we make up (and I love it when we make up, yeah, hey, hey)
Go 'head, ruin my make up (ahead, ruin my make up, yeah, hey, hey)
I love it when we make up (and I love it when we make up, yeah, hey, hey)
Go 'head, ruin my make up (go ahead, ruin my make up, yeah, hey, hey)

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Oh no, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Mmm, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh huh
