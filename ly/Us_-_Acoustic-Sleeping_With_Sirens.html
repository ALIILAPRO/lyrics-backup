		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't looked at love the same
I used to think it was a game
Put on a smile, a happy face
But underneath we hide our fangs
Now I see if you can love
The hardest parts, the worst in us
Ain't that what it's all about?
With you now, I have no doubt

In another place, in another life
In another space, in another time

And for every day that keeps going by
We'll be okay if we can try

So what about love?
And what about trust?
Is it still me that you are only thinking of?
What about us?
Is what we're feeling still enough?
So what about love?
And what about you?
What about me?
What about us?

What about you and me?

You're the only one for me
The only one I still believe
The rise and falls and ups and downs
You saved me from myself somehow
In my heart, I must confess
I haven't always done my best
You're still the only one for me
Won't give up on you
Don't give up on me

In another place, in another life
In another space, in another time

We don't have to feel this way anymore

And for every day that keeps going by
We'll be okay if we can try

All we have to do is open the door

So what about love? (What about love?)
What about trust? (What about trust?)
Is it still me that you are only thinking of?
(Is it me you're thinking of?)
What about us? (What about us?
Is what we're feeling still enough?
So what about love?
What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
(Is it me you're thinking of?)

What about love?
And what about trust?
Is it still me that you are only thinking of?
What about us?
Is what we're feeling still enough?
What about love?
What about you?
What about me?
What about us? (Us?)

What about you and me?
What about us? (What about us?)
What about you and me?
