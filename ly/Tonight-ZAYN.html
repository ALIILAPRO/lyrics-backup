		<p>
		  Just let me talk
You know what I'm saying
Don't give me that
Girl I know you're staying
Where you going?
You feel that space, it's mine
Said we're going?
In every space and time

But love me tonight
Sweet girl of mine
Take all your time
I know that you're mine

So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come

Tell me why it's always different in the morning
Last night you were by my side
Space and time, I wanna fall into your eyes
There's no point in stalling, there's nothing to hide
Right now it's priceless, some things you can't buy
You're that protection that keeps me alive
Oh you got it right, you got it right

But love me tonight
Sweet girl of mine
Take all your time
I know that you're mine (I know that you're mine)

So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come

No matter where you are
Or where you'll be
When you're feeling yourself
I know you're thinking of me

But love me tonight
Sweet girl of mine
Take all your time
I know that you're mine

So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
