		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She knows that I've been doing something wrong
But she won't say anything
She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday
But she won't mind me lying
Because

Mother stands for comfort
Mother will hide the murderer

It breaks the cage
And fear escapes and takes possession
Just like a crowd rioting inside
Make me do this, make me do that
Make me do this, make me do that
Am I the cat that takes the bird
To her the hunted, not the hunter? 

Mother stands for comfort
Mother will hide the murderer
Mother hides the madman
Mother will stay mum

Mother stands for comfort
Mother will stay mum
Stands for comfort
