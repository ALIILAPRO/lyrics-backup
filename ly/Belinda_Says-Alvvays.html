		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't explain my ankle sprain
I didn't really feel it
New dress could turn your head
But how long 'til we reel it in?

Paradise
And I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well

Blue Rev behind the rink
I didn't really need it
Circumspect when you call collect
To see if I would keep it

Paradise
And I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well terrified
But I'll find my way

Moving to the country
Gonna have that baby
Wait tables in town
I know word gets around
Moving to the country
Gonna have this baby
See how it goes
See how it grows

And I find myself paralyzed
Knowing all too well terrified
But I'll find my way

I'll egress to Inverness
With nothing in my pocket
Belinda says that heaven is a place on Earth
Well, so is hell

And we'll all get help paradise
And we'll start another life
