		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So it left you blinded soft and binded tied to your angry chair it raised
Its hammer and smashed you under yet still you seem to care love &
DespairIt's just one more bite a little closer to the bone and the left
Side's gone it never lasts that longYou look up now, eyes hollow your
Weakness flows through the air you clench your fist and smash in guilt
Child lost and without a prayer love & despair I don't want to...I don't
Want to try I don't want to cry Oh yes, love she'll lie I'm sick of all
This....Now emptiness is upon you as pain casts it's glassy stare hates now
The child that you rise and the reason you gave for the mess that you made
If only you could be saved but all the times that you prayed were only
Washed down the drain after all's said and done.....it will still be the same
