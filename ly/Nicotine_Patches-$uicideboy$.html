		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Triple Six

Hold up, wait
Hold up, wait
All of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
One day, I will forget their name
One day, I'll forget their name, name, name (hold up, wait!)
Hold up, wait
All of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
One day, I will forget their name
One day, I'll forget their name, name, name

When I was twenty-seven every night I had dreams to die
Now I'm twenty-eight feeling more dead than alive
Twenty-nine in a month, all my idols fucking dead
Got a check, more or less, just another problem
Breaking four-hundred degrees, no limit cash money
Half a milli' pass the cash, I feel like cash money
Pop a Xan, couldn't tell you when
I forget
Fuck a friend
All I need is $crim and my kin (Ruby!)
Days looking grim, goosebumps on my skin
Hope the reaper come and hope my demise begin
Fill my vein with heroin
Poking through my skin
This is the end

(Hold up, wait!)
Hold up, wait
All of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
One day, I will forget their name
One day, I'll forget their name, name, name

One day, I'll become the same
A pile of ashes forgotten in a vase
Wrap my chain around the base and then put it on display
Flashing lights they shine so brightly
'Til it blackouts every night see
Shattered glass rain from the sky
Beware my dream (aye)
That shit so blinding
White gold blade on a bright gold chain
Ruby da Cherry been dated, so why the fuck would I not stay the same?
Every step that Ruby take, it like he walking on a plank
Let the waves crash down, let them take me to my grave
Ain't no way my gang ain't grey
Thousands of people are shouting but $uicide just saved the day
Roll up in the tank
Fuck the fame
Remember my name
Until your memory fades
Like you manning the plague
Until my dying day

"Tens of people arrested
Several ounces of a deadly drug are now off the streets of St. Tammany Parish
All after several law enforcement agencies joined forces"
