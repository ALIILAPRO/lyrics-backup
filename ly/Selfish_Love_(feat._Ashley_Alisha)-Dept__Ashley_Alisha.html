		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need your selfish love
When you're lonely, you say I'm the one
Baby please, reality's
My feelings for you are starting to come undone
Don't want one-sided love
'Cause you'll hurt me, just to save yourself
Baby please, honestly
This is the end of us
Enough is enough

Used to think
Whatever you said
Was straight from your heart
There's nothing left
Between you and I
Empty words from the start
I wish that I saw this was coming
Before I ever was in too deep
But I know now is the time
To set myself free

Know that you're selfish
And you told me that you can't even help it
But I promise that
I can't keep up with you all the time
That I can't keep up with you all the time

I don't need your selfish love
When you're lonely, you say I'm the one
Baby please, reality's
My feelings for you are starting to come undone
Don't want one-sided love
'Cause you'll hurt me, just to save yourself
Baby please, honestly
This is the end of us
Enough is enough

I think that you are who you are, girl
No matter what I say, you won't change
Like all of our years that went to waste
'Cause what's the point of lying
I don't ever do that
Manipulate me over and over I know that
I'm foolish for my crying
Shouldn't ever said that
Well, lately I'm done with the games
Don't you try it

I just hope that one day
There's a smile on my face
Glad I didn't just stay
And keep wasting all my love
That I deserve back

That I deserve why all this hurt no
Better or worse
You are not the first no
I think that you are better off not in my life

I don't need your selfish love
When you're lonely, you say I'm the one
Baby please, reality's
My feelings for you are starting to come undone
Don't want one-sided love
'Cause you'll hurt me, just to save yourself
Baby please, honestly
This is the end of us
Enough is enough
