		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Knew the signs
Wasn't right
I was stupid for a while
Swept away by you
And now I feel like a fool
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be

Catch myself
From despair
I could drown
If I stay here
Keeping busy everyday
I know I will be okay

But I was
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be

So much hurt
So much pain
Takes a while
To regain
What is lost inside
And I hope that in time
You'll be out of my mind
And I'll be over you

But now I'm
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach
So far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be

Out of reach
So far
You never gave your heart
In my reach, I can see
There's a life out there
For me
