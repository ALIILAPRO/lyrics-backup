		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here behind the curtain lies a darkness feeding
Pooled inside, in hunger cries, and still it's eating
Everything I had to hide is all on my sleeve
And behind the curtain lies my soul, I'm bleeding

And I see it
Can't believe it
And the sun goes down
Taking my heart

What is this I'm feeling?
Is it a new beginning?
Am I purging past regrets
Facing the hurt I'm dealing?

How does one start healing?
The darkness is revealing
The bittersweet reality
That this is the help I'm needing

Why must I be bastardized? My essence flees
Search my mind and all I find is banded feelings
Once you pull the bandage off, you feel the sting
Only way to fix it is through painful suffering

And I see it
Can't believe it
And the sun goes down
Taking my heart

What is this I'm feeling?
Is it a new beginning?
Am I purging past regrets
Facing the hurt I'm dealing?

How does one start healing?
The darkness is revealing
The bittersweet reality
That this is the help I'm needing

Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me

Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Is he free, is he full, is he high, is he low?
Where the fuck I'm supposed to go?
Where the fuck I'm supposed to go?

Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Take a look around at the morning star, he's coming for me
Is he friend, is he foe, is he high, is he low?
Where the fuck I'm supposed to go?
Where the fuck I'm supposed to go?

Feel me, heal me
All that's in me
Give it all back
I can't have this
Feeling, failing
All that's creating

Get the fuck out
Get the fuck out
Get the fuck out
Get the fuck out
Get the fuck out
Get the fuck out
