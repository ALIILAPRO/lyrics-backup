		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Look, huh, on the wake up, brush my teeth
I lied, I think I grabbed the Glock instead (you like that, huh?)
(Keep goin', go 'head)
Yeah, look
If I die before I wake I pray to Heaven that the roofless in
(Yeah, that's kinda dark, but keep goin')
Bitch, huh, spend some hunnids on some pendants
Couple hunnids on some stupid shit
Hunnids in my bank account
Got Glocks up in the newest whips
Heard they want it, want it, look
They know how we comin' then
Heard they want it, want it, look
They know how we comin' then

They know how we comin'
I go broke, then your pockets, I might run it
Bitches call me daddy, heard that I be sonin' niggas
Pussy, why you runnin', nigga?
Look, I'm in the spot, huh, and bro got the drop
If I feel a way, then he feel a way
We makin' it hot, clear out the block
Take off your top, lil' mama
I want a brand new chopper
She want a trip to the Bahamas
Can't do it, lil' bro need Pradas
Like, ah, nah, hol' on
I gotta get it, huh, like what's up with it (hol' on)
Bro pop off, say he tryna go drillin'

Look, huh, on the wake up, brush my teeth
I lied, I think I grabbed the Glock instead (you like that, huh?)
(Keep goin', go 'head)
Yeah, look
If I die before I wake I pray to Heaven that the roofless in
(Yeah, that's kinda dark, but keep goin')
Bitch, huh, spend some hunnids on some pendants
Couple hunnids on some stupid shit
Hunnids in my bank account
Got Glocks up in the newest whips
Heard they want it, want it, look
They know how we comin' then
Heard they want it, want it, look
They know how we comin' then

Lil' bitch, it's Sheff G to you
Disrespect and you receive a punishment
Winners Circle, winnin', winnin'
We bring that interest in
Know that boy ain't wit' it, wit' it
So stop the foolishness
Metro's only way of livin'
'Cause we be boomin' shit

Shoot up the party
M8N3N gang gonna shoot up the party, hey, hey
Shoot up the party
M8V3N gang gonna shoot up the party
I could tell you the trap but I whisper
Fuck your bitch from the back and dismiss her
Couple racks for your life, they won't miss ya
NFL how I'm plottin' on blitzin'
Leave that boy twitchin'
