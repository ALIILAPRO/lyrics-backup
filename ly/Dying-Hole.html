		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see the cripple dance 
Pay your money, baby 
Now's your chance 
Eyes like cyanide 

I am so dumb 
Just beam me up 
I've had it all forever 
I've had enough 

Remember, you promised me 
I'm dying, I'm dying, please 
I want to, I need to be 
Under your skin 

Our love is quicksand 
So easy to drown 
They steal the gravity, yeah 
From moving ground 

Remember, you promised me 
I'm dying, I'm dying, please 
I want to, I need to be 
Under your skin 

And now I understand 
You leave with everything 
You leave with everything I am 
Withering 

And now I know that love is dead 
You've come to bury me 
There's nothing left here to pretend 
Anything 

Remember, you promised me 
I'm dying, I'm dying, please 
I want to, I need to be 
Under your skin 

I'm dying, I'm dying, please 
I'm dying, I'm dying, please 
I'm dying, I'm dying, please 
Under your skin 

Under your skin
