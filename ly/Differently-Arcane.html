		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby when lightning strikes you twice
I'll be there for you
When you feel down forget to smile
I'll bring life to you
Cuz you hit me differently
I'm talking differently
I'm movin' differently
With you girl I feel free
You hit me differently
I'm talking differently
I'm movin' differently
Burnin up, motion less, fair to say
I've drowned in love once before
Lost some faith along the way gained it back
Lady luck, you lift me up, heaven sent
Left me a stray, when she left me for him
Had lost my way, you forced a certain change
It feels so strange, I'm out here got some fame
I heard you pray, when you hear them say my name
That's why
Baby when lightning strikes you twice
I'll be there for you
When you feel down forget to smile
I'll bring life to you
Cuz you hit me differently
I'm talking differently
I'm movin' differently
With you girl I feel free
You hit me differently
I'm talking differently
I'm movin' differently
