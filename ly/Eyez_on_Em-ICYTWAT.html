		<p>
		  I gotta-I gotta one-take this shit, uh, ayy, huh, uh
Ayy, ayy, uh, I don't need a, ayy
Uh, G-lock, know I keep it, huh
Ayy, G-lock, know I keep it, huh

G-lock, know I keep it close
Keep me calm, case a nigga out here tryna do the most, uh
Ayy, fe-fi-foe'nem leave you toast
I can see it in his eyes, he gon fold up when it's smoke, hol' up
Ayy, keep eyes on 'em 'cause I know
Niggas snakes in disguise, when it's up I'm on his ho, hold up, uh
Ayy, keep eyes on 'em 'cause I know
He might die about his pride if I treat him like a ho
Hol' up, ayy
Ayy, keep eyes on 'em, he ain't cloaked, hol' up, ayy
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, ayy, huh, ayy
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, ayy, huh, ayy
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low

Re-rock, niggas stole the flow, but it's calm
'Cause a nigga got a bout a hunnid more, ayy
Cheap highs, I don't know 'bout those
Sippin' fast, I done prolly spent about a hunnid more, hol' up
Ayy, rap game full of buncha hoes, no surprise
Give it time and we gon' see who really fold, hol' up, ayy
Cheat codes, better play your role, when it's mine
I'mma pack these niggas up and send 'em home

Ayy, G-lock, know I keep it close
Keep me calm, case a nigga out here tryna do the most, uh
Ayy, fe-fi-foe'nem leave you toast
I can see it in his eyes, he gon fold up when it's smoke, hol' up
Ayy, keep eyes on 'em 'cause I know
Niggas snakes in disguise, when it's up I'm on his ho, hold up, uh
Ayy, keep eyes on 'em 'cause I know
He might die about his pride if I treat him like a ho
Hol' up, ayy
Ayy, keep eyes on 'em, he ain't cloaked, hol' up, ayy
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, ayy, huh, ayy
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, hol' up, ayy, huh, ayy
Keep eyes on 'em, he ain't low, uh

Ayy, G-lock, know I keep it
Ayy, fe-fi-foe'nem leave you
Fe-fi-foe'nem leave you
Ayy, damn, ayy
