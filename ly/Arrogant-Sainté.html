		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ok I’m arrogant
Eating lobster with asparagus
Baby girl check how I’m balancing

I’m overseas
They ain’t no checking on me
Eat grind sleep repeat
Get the money all steep

Weekend
Im getting money your boyfriend is sleeping
Plan a vacation your girlfriend is scheming
Baby I’m sweet please don’t call me a demon
Hard in the paint man I’m killing the season

Ok ok
I’m getting the hunnids ok
She like me I tell her ok
Might slide in the day
I know that she feeling a way

Ok ok
I’m getting the hunnids ok
She like me I tell her ok
Might slide in the day
I know that she feeling a way

I know that you
Like the way I flex
Baby girl what’s next
I told you that I could be your next
Please forget your ex

I know that you
Like the way I flex
Baby girl what’s next
I told you that I could be your next
Please forget your ex

Yeah BB for the summer
I’m tryna push P like I’m gunna
I’m floating ahlie
4 double 0 man ahlie
Baby come ride on my bike
You know what I like
You ain’t even gotta lie
Given a rating it’s 5
Bae I’m your guy
This ain’t a regular vibe
You be the one on mind

Cool for the evening
Baby I’m good for the season
Sending you seasonal greetings
I do not kiss and tell
I’m up tryna get me some wealth
Sorry bro can’t you tell

Bell my cell
Im tryna get sugar like Kel
Can’t chill with a regular girl
I need me a glitter bae
You say you lit but I’m litter bae

She wanna go on vacation
And flex on her friends
Baby with me
You gon need to be patient
Cah I’m ghosting again

You know I can’t stay
No time for a bae
I grind in the night it’s the same in day
You can’t beef with Sainte just go and get paid
I started a sound so we can’t be the same

To get it together
I’m cheffing up cheddar

Ok ok
I’m getting the hunnids ok
She like me I tell her ok
Might slide in the day
I know that she feeling a way

Ok ok
I’m getting the hunnids ok
She like me I tell her ok
Might slide in the day
I know that she feeling a way

I know that you
Like the way I flex
Baby girl what’s next
I told you that I could be your next
Please forget your ex

I know that you
Like the way I flex
Baby girl what’s next
I told you that I could be your next
Please forget your ex
