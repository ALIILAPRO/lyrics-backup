		  It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker (BIA, BIA)
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker

Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old
And don't keep me 'round no ho shit, these hoes get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe white just to match with my toes, yeah

I can't wear the shit you bitches wear because it's cheap to me
It's some money at my table, grab a seat with me
Cost a ticket just to cover all my legal fees
I don't hang with jealous bitches, that's a weak disease
Ho, don't run up
If you broke and in my business, then just shut up
I invested in my body bitch, I'm done up
I look good, I like to fuck him when the sun up, uh

I put on my jewelry just to go to the bodega
And I keep it with me just so that I'm feeling safer
Fendi on my body, but my feet is in Bottega
Bitch, I'm getting money, give a fuck about a hater

It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker

Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old
And don't keep me 'round no ho shit, these hoes get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe white just to match with my toes, yeah

White on white Bentley, trunk got the engine
Ho tryna get near me, bitch, stay up outta my mentions
Birkin bag, got plenty, twenty racks and Fendi
Got time for these messy hoes in my business, I ain't with it
Got right now, not next, need M's on all of my checks
Don't worry 'bout who I text, just know it ain't my ex
Lotta rich niggas in here, no bitch niggas in here
When the pack landed a check cleared and this what you hear, uh

I put on my jewelry just to go to the bodega
And I keep it with me just so that I'm feeling safer
Fendi on my body, but my feet is in Bottega
Bitch, I'm getting money, give a fuck about a hater

It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker

Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old
And don't keep me 'round no ho shit, these hoes get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe white just to match with my toes

(BIA, BIA)
