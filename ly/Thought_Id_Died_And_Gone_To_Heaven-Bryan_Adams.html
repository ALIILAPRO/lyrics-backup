		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is forever, as I lie awake
Beside you
I believed, there's no heaven
No hideaway, for the lonely

But I was wrong, crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right

Only wanted to stay a while
Only wanted to play a while
Then you taught me to fly like a bird

Baby, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
'Cause what I got there ain't no cure for

Oh it's so easy
What you do to me all night angel
I never loved, I swear to God
Never needed no one, 'til you came along

Here I come baby
It's gotta be strong, it's gotta be right
Only wanted to stay awhile 
Only wanted to play awhile
Then you taught me to fly like a bird

Baby, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
'Cause what I got there ain't no cure for

I feel fast asleep, I feel drunk
I dream the sweetest dreams
Never wanna wake up

Never thought it could be this way
No doubt about it, can't live without it
Never thought it could be this good
You made love to me, the way it ought to be

But I was wrong, crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right

Only wanted to stay a while
Only wanted to play a while
Then you taught me to fly like a bird

Baby, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
'Cause what I got there ain't no cure for

Got say, thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Never thought that I could feel this way yeah (thought I'd died and gone to heaven)
It's gotta be love (it's gotta be love)
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven heaven
