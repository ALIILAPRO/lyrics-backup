		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tread lightly, fool. And embrace your impending gloom!

Yeah, I am lurking in the dark, killing light
My blackened poetry will turn your days into night
As shadows fall you'll quickly sense that I'm here
You'll have a constant fear that something is always near

Now, something's moving, is it all in your head?
Is it the wind or someone under your bed?
Obscure wickedness is what shadows hide
Don't underestimate the power of the dark side
Pitch-black death awaits you!

Yeah, obscure wickedness is what shadows hide
Don't underestimate the power of the dark side
Pitch-black death awaits you!

No more putting me in a dark light fools
Prepare to be devoured by darkness!

Fade to black!
