		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been sending drunk texts
So I can't even remember all the things that I said to you
Probably 'cause I'm upset (upset)
And this pain that I'm feelin' great enough to be shared by two
You used to be obsessed (obsessed)
Now you won't even glance in my direction when I walk in the room
Used to get you undressed (undressed)
So it's hard to admit it, but I still got a lot to prove

Because you're in my head, in my head, in my head again
Where I keep it, case I need you, I can't let it end
In my head, in my head, in my head again
Ain't a secret, you my weakness, shouldn't have let you in
In my head, in my head, in my head again
Where I keep it, case I need you, I can't let it end
In my head, in my head, in my head again
Ain't a secret, you my weakness, shouldn't have let you in

You remind me of my first car (skrrt)
A little rough around the edges, came straight from Texas (yeah)
You used to be my lone star
You took away the stressin' and all the second guessin'
But now you just a lost cause (ooh)
Tryin' to find (find) some meaning inside (side)
I can't believe I lost us (ooh)
And it doesn't feel right at all

That's why I'm standin' outside for you (you)
Spendin' every dime on you (you)
Wish I never lied to you (you)
I need another try with you

Because you're in my head, in my head, in my head again
Where I keep it, case I need you, I can't let it end
In my head, in my head, in my head again
Ain't a secret, you my weakness, shouldn't have let you in
In my head, in my head, in my head again
Where I keep it, case I need you, I can't let it end
In my head, in my head, in my head again
Ain't a secret, you my weakness, shouldn't have let you in

In my head (in my head)
In my head (in my head)
In my head (in my head)
In my head (in my head)
Ooh
Ooh
