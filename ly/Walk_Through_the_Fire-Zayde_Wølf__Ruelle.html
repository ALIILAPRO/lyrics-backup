		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm always wondering
if it's ever gonna end.
I can feel it in my bones.
I can feel it in my bones. Standing in the dust
of what's left of us.
I can see you in my soul
yeah I can see you in my soul
Did we take too many chances Did we let too many pass us Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we light too many matches? Turned ourselves into these ashes. Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
We walk through the fire!
Is there a way out? Is there a way out? We walk through the fire!
Is there a way out? Is there a way out?
I try to understand,
how we're here again.
In the middle the storm.
In the middle of the storm. There's nowhere to go,
but straight through the smoke. The fight is all we know.
The fight is all we know.
Did we take too many chances Did we let too many pass us Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
Did we light too many matches? Turned ourselves into these ashes. Did we throw it all away?
Did we throw it all away?
We walk through the fire!
Is there a way out? Is there a way out?
We walk through the fire!
Is there a way out? Is there a way out?
I wanna know, is there a way out
