		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can be who you wanna be
You can be who you wanna be

Went from tryna pay the rent
Used the pen on men and made a dent
Yeah, time and again make it go top ten
No, I'm not a politician and not UN
When I meet face to face, yeah, don't be late
I be talkin' on the phone, yeah, I'm not gonna wait
When you gotta tell me you better locate
If it's takin' up my time then you beep-beep

Yeah, I'm tryna come through, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm bringin' somethin' new, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm tryna come through, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm bringin' somethin' new

There's no limit, I'm tryna feel it
Every time I see you, well, I'm gonna break through it
Gotta just be it, be happy and do it
No one can stop it, if they wanna they can try it

Next gen transcend women and men
Bringin' noise, make it count, yeah, do it again
Never stop, never give up, don't pretend
Tell a friend all the rules you're gonna bend
I tried to tell you all what will happen to you
I tried to make you see I was tellin' the truth
I was tryna be everything you want me to be
I can't please everyone, I'ma let it beep, beep, beep

Yeah, I'm tryna come through, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm bringin' somethin' new, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm tryna come through, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm bringin' somethin' new

There's no limit, I'm tryna feel it (you can be who)
Every time I see you, well, I'm gonna break through it (you can be who)
Gotta just be it, be happy and do it (you can be who)
No one can stop it, if they wanna they can try it

If I end up somewhere bad then I'ma move through it
When I break through it, you can all feel it
All the things I said, yeah, you can all see it
No matter who you are, I'ma try to free it, beep-beep

Yeah, I'm tryna come through, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm bringin' someone new, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm tryna come through, beep-beep
Yeah, I'm bringin' someone new

Be free, like you already knew
Be free, do what you gotta do
Be free, like you already knew
Be free, do what you gotta do

You can be who you wanna be
You can be who you
