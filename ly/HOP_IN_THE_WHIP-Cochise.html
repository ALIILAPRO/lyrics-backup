		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy (eurmm), hop in a whip, hop in a Track' (ayy)
Hop in a eurmm (ayy), hop in the back (ayy)
Hop in a eurmm, hop in the Scat' (eurmm)
Addicted to money, addicted to racks (eurmm)
Addicted to money, addicted to packs (ayy)
My brother sold militants right through the cracks (cracks)
These niggas is cappin', they don't got no plaques

Sweet (sweet, sweet), she not with it, delete (delete it)
I pulled up, I put her to sleep (that's facts)
The wallaby loafers the feet (that's facts)
Okay, I told her the jewelry on fleek (that's facts)
Okay, I'm Luffy, I'm out with the fleet (that's facts)
Okay, she hungry, I gave her some meat
Okay, I told her that we gotta, huh, yes
I told her that we gotta, huh (that's facts, okay)
(Eurmm) where ya walkin'?
(Eurmm) where ya walkin'?
Niggas ain't with it, they talkin' nonsense
My money lockin', no Stephen Hawking
You don't get money, bro, why you talkin'? (Eurmm)
Why ya talkin'? (Ayy)
Shawty, gave sloppy, askin' for a kiss (ayy)
I told her stop and disappear in mist (uh, uh, eurmm)
Diamonds all up on my wrist (diamonds, eurmm)
Shawty tryna take a lick (hop in the, eurmm)
Pour me up, I'm tryna sip (hop in the, eurmm)
She not suckin', better dip (ayy, hop in the )
I'm in New York, I'm ballin' like the Knicks (eurmm)
Misbehavin' like a pit (hop in the, eurmm)
Told 'em lay up on the chips (hop in the, eurmm)
Nigga grabbin' every tip

Ayy (eurmm), hop in a whip, hop in a Track' (ayy)
Hop in a eurmm (ayy), hop in the back (ayy)
Hop in a eurmm, hop in the Scat' (eurmm)
Addicted to money, addicted to racks (eurmm)
Addicted to money, addicted to packs (ayy)
My brother sold militants right through the cracks (cracks)
These niggas is cappin', they don't got no plaque

Run it up (ayy), run it up (ayy)
Run it up (ayy), run it up (yes)
I get the money, the bag
I wipe my ass, just for the hunnid bucks
Got the suey on me, I be fitted up
Niggas mad 'cause they know they ain't lit as us
I said me and Brayden better pick 'em up
Told that nigga come here, countin' piggy money

Nigga, he over there talkin', I told him to shut it, yeah, yeah
Shawty, you know I'm a freak and I told her to suck it
Yeah, she bounce on the dick, she bounce on the tip
She bringin' the fat, yeah, yeah
She makin' the cut, she makin' the racks, she makin' it back, yeah
You know I'ma do it again (again)
You know I don't fuck with your friends (friends)
Shawty, you know they be hatin', they be talkin' that shit
Shawty, you know, I be playin', but I really be him
Girl, you know I be ballin' like I'm hittin' the gym
And you know I be callin', they be pointin', "That's him"
That's me, pull up, I hop in the V
No, I don't run double B
I'm on my bag, double C
Ain't got no guts, she want eat
Ain't no way, you talkin' to me
I count money, forgot how to read
I can buy what I want and I need
Young nigga, I'm rich and I'm black
I can buy 'bout like four hundred trees
I can burn them then do it again
I'm so blessed, I can do what I please
I thank God every morning and night
I just hope that I'm doin' my deeds, huh
