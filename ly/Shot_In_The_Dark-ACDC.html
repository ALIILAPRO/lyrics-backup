		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a pick me up
A rollin' thunder truck
I need a shot of you
That tattooed lady wild
Like a mountain wide
I got a hunger, that's the loving truth

You got a long night coming
And a long night pumping
You got the right position
The heat of transmission

A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric sparks
A shot in the dark
Beats a walk in the park, yeah

Blast it on the radio
Breaking on the TV show
Send it out on all the wires
And if I didn't know any better
Your mission is to party
'Til the broad daylight

You got a long night coming
And a long night going
You got the right position
The heat of transmission

A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric spark
A shot in the dark
Beats a walk in the park, yeah

My mission is to hit ignition

A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah, electric sparks
A shot in the dark
Beats a walk in the park, yeah

A shot in the dark
Ooh, a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
Beats a walk in the park, yeah
