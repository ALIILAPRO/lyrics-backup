		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your hands up 'cause I won't 
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't 
Get your ass up 'cause I won't
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel

(Hello, hello)
Hello, how you doin'? Am I talkin' too fast?
I'm runnin' on adrenaline and one-hour naps
'Cause I do what you tell me to and do it to death
Do it death 

Acapulco, Tel Aviv or maybe Japan
And pretty people yell at me to follow the dance
So I do what you tell me to and do it to death
But I can't do this shit again

Put your hands up 'cause I won't (right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (my, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (my, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel

(I don't, I don't, I don't)
I don't got a body like I see in the press
So I got to the precipice of pressin' my chest
And now I look impressive with a couple of pecs
Just like my friends 

So welcome back and take a breath
You've come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back and take a breath
You've come to life but I digress

Put your hands up 'cause I won't (right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (my, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (my, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype but maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel

So welcome back and take a breath
You've come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back and take a breath
You've come to life, you're bored to death
So welcome back

Acapulco, Tel Aviv or maybe Japan 
And pretty people yell at me to follow the dance 
So I do what you tell me to and do it to death 
But I can't do this shit again

Put your hands up 'cause I won't (right on time)
Raise a glass up 'cause I won't (my, oh, my) (I won't)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype
But maybe that's the way I feel
Put your hands up 'cause I won't (right on time)
I'm not here 'cause you say so (my, oh, my)
Get your ass up 'cause I won't (I won't)
I must've missed the hype but maybe that's the way I feel
That's the way I feel
