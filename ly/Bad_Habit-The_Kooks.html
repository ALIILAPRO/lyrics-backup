		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby got her head down
Baby got her head down to the ground
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love
You gotta dot your I's and cross your t's
You gotta let go and come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You say you want it but you can't get it, and you
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Well, look at you, walkin' up and down the hall
Sayin', "Please, save me" (my bad habit)
You say you want it but you can't get it, and you (my bad habit)
You got yourself a bad habit for it (my bad habit)
Well, look at you, walkin' up and down the hall
Sayin', "Please, oh man, oh man, oh man
You know I wish I had it all"

Baby got her head down
Baby trying to stand out in the crowd
Looking for a stranger
Looking for (a stranger to love)
You know you gotta dot your I's and cross your t's
You gotta let go and come with me
Looking for a stranger
Looking for a stranger to love

You say you want it but you can't get it, and you
You got yourself a bad habit for it
Well, look at you, walkin' up and down the hall
Sayin', "Please, save me" (my bad habit)
You say you want it but you can't get it, and you (my bad habit)
You got yourself a bad habit for it (my bad habit)
Well, look at you, walkin' up and down the hall
Sayin', "Please, oh man, oh man, oh man
You know I wish I had it all"

You know I wish I had it all

You say you want it but you can't get it, and you (my bad habit)
You got yourself a bad habit for it (my bad habit)
Well, look at you, walkin' up and down the hall
Sayin', "Please, oh man, oh man, oh man" (my bad habit)
You can't get it, it's a, a bad habit (my bad habit)
Such a, a bad habit, such a bad, bad habit
It's a, a bad habit
