		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, yeah) yeah
Yeah (Loesoe going crazy)
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah (ayy)

Bust down watch, bust down ring
Yeah, this ain't plain jane
I got swag, ayy, for days, ayy
They rockin' the same thing (yeah, yeah)
Bells ring when you say my name
If you talk down, I'm gon' bang
If you talkin' down, I'm gon' shoot
I'ma pull up on you and your gang
I'ma pull up on you and your gang
I'ma pull up, rock out with that shit (yeah)
How this nigga ain't never ever catch a body
But he call himself John Wick? (Yeah)
How these niggas ain't never ever catch a body
But they always posted with sticks? (Yeah)
Yeah, these niggas be posted up with them guns (yeah)
But they never shot shit (yeah)

Pussy boy never popped shit (nah)
Pussy boy, you not poppin' (nah)
Pussy boy, need to stop it (yeah)
Pussy boy, need to stop it (yeah)
Money in my bag 'cause I can't fit it in my wallet (yeah)
Them niggas, they smoke anemic, my boys, we smoke exotic (yeah)
Shawty said she wanna keep my kid, but I ain't ready to be no papi (hell nah)
I ain't tryna fuck no more, whoa, suck me sloppy (oh, whoa)
I'm up my opps, I ain't gotta check the score, I know that I got it
I'm in your city right now and I'm 'bout to do a show
Tell me, who gon' stop me? (Nobody)
Who gon' stop me? (Nobody)
All of these niggas be hoes, they ain't on shit (yeah)
Niggas going out sad, bad, and they say it's up, all about a bitch (yeah)
I can't go out bad, sad, nah
'Cause I'm way too up, yeah, I'm way too rich (yeah)
I'm just way, way too lit (yeah)
I just care more about my shit (yeah)
I just give a little bit of fucks (yeah)
And these niggas, they don't give no fucks (yeah)
That's why all of they hoes wanna fuck me
'Cause they know my swag contagious like a disease (yeah)
You in her DM, I got this ho on her knees (yeah)
You worry 'bout a bitch, but that bitch, she ain't none to me
Yeah, these niggas be tripping about these fleas
These niggas be tripping

Bust down watch, bust down ring
Yeah, this ain't plain jane
I got swag, ayy, for days, ayy
They rockin' the same thing
Bells ring when you say my name
If you talk down, I'm gon' bang
If you talkin' down, I'm gon' shoot
I'ma pull up on you and your gang
I'ma pull up on you and your gang
I'ma pull up, rock out with that shit
How this nigga ain't never ever catch a body
But he call himself John Wick?
How these niggas ain't never ever catch a body
But they always posted with sticks?
Yeah, these niggas be posted up with them guns
But they never shot shit
