		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is an emergency broadcast alert
Please listen carefully
An unknown threat is inbound
Seek immediate shelter
This is not a drill

Siren head, Siren Head, Siren Head, Siren Head
Lurkin' round the corner you gon wish that you was fuckin' dead
Siren head, Siren Head, Siren Head, 
He's creeping on ya, might fuckin' run ya

Momma told me not to go out by myself late at night
Siren Head lurking, why he wanna take my life?
I think I'm hearing voices, is it all in my head
Saying "come into the forest 'cause it's better when you're dead"
Got this eerie feeling something's underneath my bed
When I turned on the lights all the walls were painted red
40 feet tall but he still stay outta sight
Say his name 4 times, he might come for you tonight (BOO!)

Siren head, Siren Head, Siren Head, Siren Head
Lurkin' round the corner you gon wish that you was fuckin' dead
Siren head, Siren Head, Siren Head, 
He's creeping on ya, might fuckin' run ya

I just wanna live, I don't wanna die
Find my body in the forest then my momma gonna cry
Don't just shed a tear, Hell burns like Everclear
It don't matter where you go Siren Head is everywhere
People keep saying they see something in the fog
Drag you through the woods, he might drown you in a bog
You can run and hide but he's always gonna find you
Now it's too late *cause he's standing right behind you*

Siren head, Siren Head, Siren Head, Siren Head
Lurkin' round the corner you gon wish that you was fuckin' dead
Siren head, Siren Head, Siren Head, 
He's creeping on ya, might fuckin' run ya
