		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was a close call
Sitting in the back of the room
With a bowl you had owned
But they didn't know
Close in on my black eye
I feel safe at times
Certain emblems
Tell me it's time

Serpents in my mind
Looking for your crimes
Everything changes
I don't want mine to this time

You enjoy sucking on dreams
So I will fall asleep with someone other than you
I had a thought you would take me seriously
And listen on

Serpents in my mind
I am searching for your crimes
Everything changes
In time

You'll stay frozen in time
Collaging girls
Controlling minds
You hold the mirror well
To everybody else

Serpents in my mind
Trying to forgive your crimes
Everyone changes in time
I hope he changes this time
