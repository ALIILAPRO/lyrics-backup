		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But over in a land that's in my back yard
There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard

Well, they found a way to live with ease
By eating from the bush instead of the trees

Apple bush, apple tree
Path to eternity
Find you a path and you follow the call

Apple bush, apple tree
Back to eternity
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall

Well, over in a corner, standing there
Telling my house that they haven't a single care

But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own
Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone

Apple Bush, apple tree
Back to eternity
Find you a path and you buy with a call

Apple bush, apple tree
Back to eternity
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall

Someday like my house you're going to chose too
If you cut this new path well the old one will do
and you live with the people who live with ease
The red apple bush, the blue apple tree
