		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're out
Tell your lucky one 
To know that you'll leave
But you don't lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not hear keys

Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed

One a time put a tongue
In your ear on the beach
And you clutched kicking heels
