		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want a girl who gets a car for her sweet sixteen
Or spends a stack of dollar bills on a limousine
I want a girl who takes the bus and who wears baggy jeans
Rockin' Nike Airs, what the hell are Louboutins?
Don't want no fake tan, short skirt, daddy's money don't work
Shop until you drop on the town
I want a smart girl, stronger than her father
Someone who will laugh at tryna fit in the crowd (ah-ow, ow)

And all we used to dream about
Is getting rich and getting out
Move to the nicer part of town
Where we'd have numbers on our house
It took a while to figure out
What type of girl that I'm about
Who brings the real man out of me, yeah

I don't really want no trust fund baby
I like my women independent
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing else
I don't want no trust fund baby
Save your money, don't spend it
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing else

I don't want a girl who takes selfies, want her makeup free
Don't want no mean girl, lady in pink, prom queen
I want a girl who climbs trees, always dirt on her jeans
Her daddy told her how to fix cars, maybe she could fix me
I want a throwback kid who loves Missy Elliot
Who for my birthday, makes a mixtape and puts it on cassette
Want a girl with common sense, who's dripping in competence
Don't wanna die to get rich but she loves Fifty Cent (ah-ow, ow)

And all we used to dream about
Is getting rich and getting out
Move to the nicer part of town
Where we'd have numbers on our house
It took a while to figure out
What type of girl that I'm about
Who brings the real man out of me, yeah

I don't really want no trust fund baby
I like my women independent
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing else
I don't want no trust fund baby
Save your money, don't spend it
And I say to people, "That's my lady"
And we don't need nothing else

(I don't want no)
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
I just want me a proper lady (no, I don't want me)
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)

I don't really want no trust fund baby
I like my women independent (hey)
And I say to people, "That's my lady" (that's my lady, na-na-na-na-na)
And we don't need nothing else

I don't want no
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
I just want me a proper lady (no, I don't want me)
I don't want no trust fund baby (no, I don't want me)
No, I don't want me
