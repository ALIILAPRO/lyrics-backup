Good dope in my trap
You hit it one time and we gon' lock up your rib cage (bitch)
Beat a nigga clean round page (beat him up)
Black gloves when I grip the cage (black gloves)

Be your bitch texts hit em' like Marvin Gaye
Drop a six inside a tropical Minute Made
Beat on my chest like i'm Willy b (beat on my chest like I'm Willy b)
These niggas my lil' mini me
Take your bitch out to eat we go to busy bee (come here)
Swingin' that choppa head shot, we don't aim at knees
Shit bad he got a stomach disease (ugh)
What you say? I cannot hear you
God keep me company so I don't fear you (God)
I got that antidote I will not cure you
Balenciaga bubble jacket is cold
He a lab rat he sniffed up his nose
Cole promised we gon' shoot up with poles
You get ten feet next to me you gon' get froze
I flew to Egypt and flew back with gold (John Wick)

Cocking back and shoot to my fam (baow)
All this water you should build a dam (Water)
Texting peons like i'm uncle Sam (peons)
Pull up in leather shit hit (shit hit)
Perfect and I would not miss
I do not go for the dissin' (start)
Start a caravan and handle my business (start the caravan)
Big bag on belt like it's Christmas (Santa Claus)
Talking shit, add your name to the hit list (scratch 'em off)
Everybody wanna fuck with a gang cause they need the protection (gang)
Only rich niggas stand in my section
Fifth generation Glock my weapon (baow)
If the bullet miss you that's your blessing
I though youngs gripping Smith and Wesson
This a million dollar lick (lick)
You better take every brick (take a bag)
A thousand bag leave a stench (stench)
Rottweilers in my fence (grr)
Send a pack to Prison yards (over there)
I know some inmates fucking guards (smash)
