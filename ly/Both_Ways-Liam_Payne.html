		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My girl, she like it both ways
She like the way it all taste
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways

Girl I can feel it
Oh yeah, I can feel what you want, yeah
Like that you're different
Yeah, do what you want, I won't judge, I won't judge

Lovin' the way that she's turning you on
Switching the lanes like a Bugatti Sport
Nothing but luck that she got me involved, yeah
Flipping that body, go head, I go tails
Sharing that body like it's our last meal
One and a two and a three, that's for real

She said, "We're young and we're stupid"
She said, "Come on, boy let's do this"
Make every day my birthday
Let's celebrate, like oh my gosh
She do things you won't believe

My girl, she like it both ways
She like the way it all taste
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways (both ways)
Both ways, both ways (both ways)

Four in the morning
Yeah, who else you wanna invite?
Never too many hands all on your body
And mine, you're all mine

Lovin' the way that she's turning you on
Switching the lanes like a Bugatti Sport
Nothing but luck that she got me involved, yeah
Flipping that body, go head, I go tails
Sharing that body like it's our last meal
One and a two and a three, that's for real

She said, "We're young (we're young) and we're stupid"
She said, "Come on, watch me while we do this"
Make every day my birthday
Let's celebrate, like oh my gosh
She do things you won't believe

My girl, she like it both ways (both ways)
She like the way it all taste (the way it all taste)
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways (both ways)
Both ways, both ways (both ways)

Make every day my birthday
Let's celebrate, like oh my gosh
She do things you won't believe

My girl, she like it both ways (both ways)
She like the way it all taste (she like the way it all taste)
Couple more, we'll call it foreplay
No, no, I don't discriminate
Bring it back to my place
Yeah, she like it both ways (both ways)
Both ways, both ways
(Said bring it back to my place, yeah, she like it both ways)
(Both ways)
Both ways, both ways
(I said bring it back to my place, yeah, she like it both ways)

(Both ways, both ways)
