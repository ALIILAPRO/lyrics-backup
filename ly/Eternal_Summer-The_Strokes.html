		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (This, and I never let it happen)
(Hey, yeah, oh)
(Hey, yeah, oh)

When I think of you
It's always on my mind
Is that story true?
No one saves the day
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't you want the truth?
Ignore reality
See, I love that feelin' too
Nobody's gonna stop right now
(Hey, yeah, oh)

Summer is coming
Won't go away
Summer is coming
It's here to stay
(Hey, yeah, oh)

I can't believe it
This is the eleventh hour
Psychedelic
Life is such a funny journey
Hercules
Your service is no longer needed
It's just like make believe
(Hey, yeah, oh)

They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
(Hey, yeah, oh)

(Hey, yeah, oh)
Now that you heard the truth
I need a friendly face
I hate that feeling too
But no one's unafraid
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't expect the truth
This is a fantasy
I fight that feeling too
But nobody's gonna stop us now
(Hey, yeah, oh)

Summer is coming
Won't go away
Summer is coming
It's here to stay
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Lo and behold the salt of the city
Pillars like time are fading away
Symphony building up to a future
Mystery to solve for somebody else
(Hey, yeah, oh)

I can't believe it
Life is such a funny journey
Psychedelic
This is the eleventh hour
Hercules
Your service is no longer needed
It's just like make believe

They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen

Everybody's on the take
Tell me, are you on the take too?
Everybody's on the take
Tell me, are you on the take too?

Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side
(Hey, yeah, oh, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look up on the bright side
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look at it on the bright side
(Hey, yeah, oh, oh)
Look up on the bright side
I'm not gonna give it to ya
Look up on the bright side
