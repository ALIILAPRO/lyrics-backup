		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bad luck wind been blowin' on my back
I was born to bring trouble wherever I'm at
With the number '13' tattooed on my neck
That ink starts to itch
Black gon' turn to red

I was born in the soul of misery
And I never had me a name
They just give me a number when I was young

Got a long line of heartache
I carry it well
The list of lives I've broken
Reach from here to Hell
And a bad luck wind been blowin' on my back
Pray you don't look at me
And I pray I don't look back

I was born in the soul of misery
And I never had me a name
They just give me a number when I was young

Found me with a preacher man confessin' all I done
Catch me with the devil playing 21
And a bad luck wind been blowin' on my back
I was born to bring trouble wherever I'm at

I was born in the soul of misery
And I never had me a name
They just give me a number when I was young
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young
