		  Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex
Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex

Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex
Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex 

Sexy girl
Get up and play with me the game of provocation
Don't be late tonight 'cause the fun is guaranteed
You want to try a more relaxing situation
Get up and dance hypnotic music is on the beat

Don't be afraid it's allright, don't run away
Don't need to turn off the light, you got to stay
Don't be afraid I won't bite, don't run away 
'Cause now I'm ready to play

Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex
Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex

Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex
Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex 

Sexy girl
You lightened up my dream, it's not immagination
Exciting feeling, no I never can deceive
We are moving in such a perfect synchopation
Get up and dance hypnotic music is on the beat

Don't be afraid it's allright, don't run away
Don't need to turn off the light, you got to stay
Don't be afraid I won't bite, don't run away
'Cause now I'm ready to play

Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex
Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex

Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex
Sexy girl sexy girl
Sex sex sex 

Sexy girl
