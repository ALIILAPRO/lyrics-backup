		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh baby, moonlights
Hits the spotlight
I'm on my flight
To take you away
I'm feeling so free
You're makin' me crazy

That's what you do
That's what you do
Let's go now!

Lickety split
A girl and a bear
She crawls in a pit
Say hello darling
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on, boy

Well come on
And take me to the other side
I'm gon' away
When I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're movin' fast
I think we got enough to lose
So don't look back or else we're gonna crash
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash

Like a first kiss
With a sweet list
Of some love songs, oh yeah
And with this melody
Falling over me
It makes me weak
So damn weak
So let's go now

Lickety split
A girl and a bear
She crawls in a pit
Say hello darling
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on, boy

Well come on
And take me to the other side
I'm gon' away
When I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're movin fast
I think we got enough to lose
So don't look back or else we're gonna crash
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la oh yea
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
So let's go now

Well come on
And take me to the other side
I'm gon' away
When I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're movin' fast
I think we got enough to lose
So don't look back or else we're gonna crash
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash
