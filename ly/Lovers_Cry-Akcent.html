		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dream of you and it feels like I am flying
I think of you when I am smiling
I am lost into your eyes
I sing our song and it feels like we are dancing
My broken heart can't stop resting
I love but is it wise..
She is born to run away
So sad that she can't stay
I wish she gives me one more day
I kiss my love good-bye
I hold her one last time
And suddenly I don't know why
Lovers cryyy..
Tell me the meaning of being together
If you keep running forever
I don't understand
What is the purpose of loving each other
Cause every day I keep wonder
If I see you again
She is born to run away 
So sad that she can't stay
I wish she gives me one more day
I kiss my love good-bye
I hold her one last time
And suddenly I don't know why
Lovers cryyy..
