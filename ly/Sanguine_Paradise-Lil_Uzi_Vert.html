		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my hoe
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

If she left with me, she the right hoe
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you can buy hoe
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door so you can hear it hit the high note

I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Money keep coming in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they tens, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging from a vine, tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin', yeah, my doors suicide

Side note, you will never reach my goals (at all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side hoe
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talking to my lil' slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality I'm 5'4
Stand on my money now I'm 6'6
Hit her once now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see a opp, make the clip hit
Aiming at his top, boy you need a mop
Man I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging from a vine, tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin', yeah, my doors suicide

Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm getting the cake now
Now stay on your stomach lil' bitch when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach lil' bitch better lay down
And I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I'm on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my hoe
She shake her ass, do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100k, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swinging from a vine, tryna put me down, but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin', yeah, my doors suicide

I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
