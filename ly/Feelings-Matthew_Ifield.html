		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It must be me
My fault for the misery
That I brought on myself for many months ‘cause I didn’t want you to leave
Now I realise how much of a fool that I have been
Thinking you’d be my everything
But you were never free

Too many times
I was left without response
You may think that I am crazy but you know that I wouldn’t do that once
And I realise how much of a fool that I have been
Staying up in bed
But now I’m living without you in my head

Tell me what you want from me?
‘Cause I don’t need to prove to see
That I don’t want you back, I never had feelings attached
Tell me what you’re wishing for,
You’re wishing for us to be more?
You never left a scratch,
But I never had feelings attached to you

Thinkin’ I could trust you was the issue
Now I have to tell myself that I don’t even miss you
And I try, and I try, and I try to deny the fact that I was so real with my feelings
Wish I realised how much of a fool that I have been
Before I opened up my world to you
(Before I opened up my world to you)
I grew up, and I
Saw what was to come
I almost wrote a song about you
But I realised how much of a fool that I have been for all this time
I’ll keep convincing myself that I don’t really need you baby

Tell me what you want from me?
‘Cause I don’t need to prove to see
That I don’t want you back, I never had feelings attached
Tell me what you’re wishing for,
You’re wishing for us to be more?
You never left a scratch,
But I never had feelings attached to you

To you
You never left a scratch but I never had any feelings attached
Woah
You never left a scratch on me girl,
Ohh

Tell me what you want from me?
‘Cause I don’t need to prove to see
That I don’t want you back, I never had feelings attached
Tell me what you’re wishing for,
You’re wishing for us to be more?
You never left a scratch,
But I never had feelings attached to you
