		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla
Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla
Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla
Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla

Ninth grade, yeah, prom dates, yeah
Raised by the internet, final stage, yeah
We could do anything by that age, yo
Niggas thought they was too good for Myspace, yo
Had the iPod Touch with the Redsn0w
Cydia, but you could pirate all the apps though
They would have security cams by the back doors
Nigga, this was Limewire on crack, though
The Touch was anything you could've asked for
Jailbreakin' it and you was hot shit, yeah
What if you could do the same for the whip, yeah?
Turn the X into a Batmobile rip, yeah
I can't wait 'til a nigga get to stuntin'
Get a Tesla and take it to West Coast Customs
Turn the touchscreen to iOS for fun
That make the auto-pilot do a donut, go dumb
Man, tell that nigga Elon I'm sorry
Tell my mom the safety features ain't adjusted
Pulled up, doors up at the party
Like I didn't cop the shit for nothin'
Niggas can't pull up in the 'Rari
But all you can change is paint and some fuck shit
And you gotta drive that shit, that ain't foreign, man
Need some shit I can hack, like fuck it

H-h-hack a Tesla car, how to hack a Tesla car
How to hack a Tesla car, how to h-
Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla
Hack a Tesla car, how to hack a Tesla car
How to hack a Tesla car, how to h-
Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla
Hack a Tesla car, how to hack a Tesla car
How to hack a Tesla car, how to h-
Fuck it, jailbreak the Tesla
Hack a Tesla car, how to hack a Tesla car
How to hack a Tesla car in under three minutes

Fuck it

I was like "Nah"
Never woulda thought I'd have a ride like mine
Ice cream paintjob on my mind
But daddy never really had a job like mine
Hotter than June, bass need the boom
Rockin' and leanin', hydraulics to cool
Lights in the roof, I think I'm Zeus
Fish in the sea, so I might need me a pool
Damn, I took like a year just to get the verse, shit
Ritchie with a T, Groggs, Parker certain
And my shit gon' have the Maybach curtains
Red leather seats just to heat the surface
Bulletproof the whip for a bullish purpose
Satellite roof, never losin' service
Keep a couple quarters, so I call him Curtis
I'm a black James Bond so I make him nervous
Your engine go "Vroom" and my engine go-
Elon on them shrooms
And Grimes' voice gon' be the GPS (Turn left)
(Yeah, yeah) This shit ain't too shabby, huh?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Zero to that 60, huh?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) You don't need to gas me, nah
(Yeah, yeah, yea) I rip them doors off 'cause I'm flashy, bitch
(Jailbreak the Tesla) Fuck around, get ghost
And I make six folds, might do a lil toast
(Jailbreak the Tesla) Drop-top X and it's better than-

Fuck it
