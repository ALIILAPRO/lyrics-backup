		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wide awake with the sacred sun 
Sending echoes out to distant places 
I hear the watch ticking on your wrist 
Sleeping beauty I could not resist you 
My head is aching from yesterday 
Feeling guilty must be on my way 

There's a voice deep inside of me 
It took me by surprise 
Now I know where my heart lies 

I'm crawling back for my life 
Pleading to my love 
I've been lost in my desire 
I was drinking, wasn't thinking 
And I'm sorry if it makes you cry 
Oh yeah 

You call me up on the telephone 
You say you need me cause you're cold and lonely 
Tempted by you, but I have to say 
Could never walk away from my girl 

There's a voice deep inside of me 
It took me by surprise 
Now I know where my soul lies 
Oh yeah 
A feeling I can't deny 
It made me realize 
Now I know why my heart cries 

Crawling back for my life 
Begging to my love 
I've been lost inside the fire 
I was drinking, wasn't thinking 
And I didn't mean to make you cry 
I was breaking the rule 
Acting like a fool 
Getting close to you 
I was a chancer, a fake romancer 
But now I know 
Where my heart is true 
Where my heart is true 

Crawling back for my life 
Pleading to my love 
I've been lost in my desire 
I was drinking, wasn't thinking 
And I'm sorry if it makes you cry 
I was breaking the rule 
Acting like a fool 
Getting close to you 
I was a chancer, a fake romancer 
But now I'm home 
Where my heart is true 
Where my heart is true
