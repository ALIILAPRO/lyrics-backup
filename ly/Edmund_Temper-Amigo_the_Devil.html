		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Edmund Temper
I have a heart like a diamond
I have a mouth made of lead
I have a way with my words, when I talk they believe every word I've said.
There was a shine in her smile
It blinds everyone's way.
I have a way with my hands and when I play with their heart it turns to clay.
So I prayed to God,
How can you give them the gift of life,
Then curse me with the hands to take it away.
I never asked you to move the mountain,
I just want the strength to climb it,
And find a different way.'
I got a hundred pound problem that I'm leaving on the side of the road
Hit the highway and I won't go back until I'm not alone
I got a game to play if you like to lose
You can turn me on, but honey I'm bad news
When you're born a shadow in everybody's mind,
Beauty is just a cancer we leave behind.
Things would be different if I were a daughter,
I dove head first into a pool without water,
To learn how to swim.
I got a hundred pound problem that I'm leaving on the side of the road
Hit the highway and I won't go back until I'm not alone
I got a game to play if you like to lose
You can turn me on, but honey I'm bad news
When I stare into the mirror,
I see all the parts I know are wrong
And can't help but wonder
Which side I'm really on.
When the whole world points to hopeless,
I just hope it wasn't all pointless
And the burden weighs too much to carry along.
I got a hundred pound problem that I'm leaving on the side of the road
Hit the highway and I won't go back until I'm not alone
I got a game to play if you like to lose
You can turn me on, but honey I'm bad news
