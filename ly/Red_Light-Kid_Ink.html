		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I-I-ISM)

Pull up at the Red Light, uh, District (ayy)
Riding off the gear right, uh, twisted (ayy)
Tell her roll the blunt tight, uh, lipstick (ayy)
Can't slow it down, came up too quick (ayy)
ISM, this a tune, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Howling at the moon, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Livin' in a dream but my eyes ain't closed (ayy)
I put everything on the line for the goals (whew)

I been getting mine, read the story untold (ayy)
Can't be mad at what you can't control (no)
Niggas gon' switch shit up with the quickness
This here risky business (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't get it twisted, that bitch vicious (whoa)
Just gave her back to the street, no West (hey)
Bg, me and my team on a mission (yeah)
Niggas try to look the other way and they miss shit
Ooh, too cool for y'all jakes (wait)
Everybody tryna move to my state (what's up?)
You ain't living in The Hills, ain't the right place (whew)
Niggas in a bad mood 'cause they ain't paid (whew)
No way, no way, no
Tell 'em they could never take my place (bitch)
Nobody higher than me
Tryna smoke what I'm smoking, gotta holla at T (okay)

Pull up at the Red Light, uh, District (ayy)
Riding off the gear right, uh, twisted (ayy) (go)
Tell her roll the blunt tight, uh, lipstick (ayy)
Can't slow it down, came up too quick (ayy)
ISM, this a tune, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Howling at the moon, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Livin' in a dream but my eyes ain't closed (ayy)
I put everything on the line for the goals (ayy)

Come back like I'm PG
Talk to 'em like a Mac, not a PC (ayy)
Had to make this shit happen, ain't no plan B (oh)
Way a nigga did the math, thought I had a degree (woo)
Tell them niggas stand back like they got a disease
We already had a wave, watch us rinse and repeat
You ain't never made an M, how you gon' critique?
Niggas married to the game, hit it while they were sleep
Whoa, wake up lil' nigga, yeah (yeah)
They did it big, watch how I do a bigger set (me)
My shit hit different like SZA (wait)
Hop in the pussy, in the grave I dig her
Ayy (ayy), I knock it down and yell timber (timber)
Run with the gang, I'm the founder and member, remember
Nobody higher than me
Tryna smoke what I'm smoking, gotta holler at T, okay

Pull up at the Red Light (Red Light), District (ayy)
Riding off the gear right (gear right), twisted (ayy)
Tell her roll the blunt tight (ooh-ooh), lipstick (ayy)
Can't slow it down, came up too quick (ayy, ayy, ayy)
ISM, this a tune, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Howling at the moon, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa (whoa)
Livin' in a dream but my eyes ain't closed
I put everything on the line for the goals
