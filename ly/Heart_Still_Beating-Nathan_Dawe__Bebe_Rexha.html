		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (My heart's still beatin')

In the start
I would cry every night to the stars
Lost and lonely
It was hard
Eventually I got me out the dark
Don't need nobody

Feel so good, feel so good, feel so good
So good to watch you go
I can't believe I survived, I'm alive
There's one thing you should know

If you think that I'm in pieces
You should know my heart's still beatin'
If you think I'm barely breathin'
You should know my heart's still beatin'

My heart's still beatin'
My heart's still beatin'

(Oh, yeah)
All the messages you sent
You were trippin' over texts
I'm cool about it
I got ice up in my chest
I'm over it, I confess
But I'm still human, I'm upset
I'm cool about it
Don't need nobody

Feel so good, feel so good, feel so good
So good to watch you go
I can't believe I survived, I'm alive
There's one thing you should know

If you think that I'm in pieces
You should know my heart's still beatin'
If you think I'm barely breathin'
You should know my heart's still beatin'

My heart's still beatin'
My heart's still beatin'
(Da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
My heart's still beatin'
(Da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
My heart's still beatin'

(You should know my heart's still beatin')
(You should know my heart's still beatin')
