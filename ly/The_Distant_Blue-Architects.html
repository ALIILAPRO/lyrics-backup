		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That distant blue, that's me and you
It was from there that we all grew
Framed in space, our first home
All those beating hearts that were made of stone
We were disaster built from flesh and bone

Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars
When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars
All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow
So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow

They couldn't tell the cure from disease
They no longer knew their want from their need
They fucked the future, forgot the past
Nothing built was built to last

A common ground, now we see
That connected us like the land and the sea

That distant blue, that's me and you
It was from there that we all grew
Framed in space, our first home
All those beating hearts that were made of stone
We were disaster built from flesh and bone

Caught in a web, don't struggle free
This is all we've got, so just let it be
If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small
We'll ask ourselves why we cared at all

Caught in a web, don't struggle free
This is all we've got, so just let it be
If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small
Ask ourselves why we cared at all
Why we cared at all
