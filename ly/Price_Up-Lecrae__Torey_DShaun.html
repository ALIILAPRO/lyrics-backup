		  Look hater how you wanna go about this?
I done switched the team up, whatchu know about this?
Purchased me in blood, and put a hole in both wrists (wrists)
Now I know my worth, and boy I know you so pissed
Oh you missed
Oh you, oh you mad now that the price up (price up, price up)
Yeah, I know you mad now that the price up 
Yeah, I know you mad now that the price up 
Oh you mad now that the price up 

Peace centered on praise (praise)
Changed all of my ways (I did)
My vision was foggy
I was wrong back in the day (yeah)
We share DNA before we ever share locations (nasty)
This ain't no vacation we just turning tricks for Satan (evil)
Jesus said He paying so I asked Him what the cost (how much?)
He just looked me up and down and pointed at the cross (woo)
I promise, He the Messiah they promised
And if you post my net worth on the web you need more commas
I'm expensive (yeah)

Look hater how you wanna go about this?
I done switched the team up, whatchu know about this?
Purchased me in blood, and put a hole in both wrists (wrists)
Now I know my worth, and boy I know you so pissed
Oh you missed
Oh you, oh you mad now that the price up (price up, price up)
Yeah, I know you mad now that the price up 
Yeah, I know you mad now that the price up
Oh you mad now that the price up 

Lucy thought she had me but I had to cut her loose
Had me looking stupid chasing pleasure like a fool
Now I'm worth the blood of Christ somebody break the news
You ain't on my level, you's a devil, you's a-

We interrupt our program to bring you this important message

Church where I was at but east Saint Louis where I'm from (you hear me)
You look like a lick they make the chopper speak in tongues
Reminiscing on them days and cleaning that dirty dish
Just so I could go get on some dirt
I didn't wanna hurt Momma little heart
But she stayed ahead of me, she prayed in the dark
Price went up (I know)
As soon as Christ went up (He lives)
No stock, you get no cut (okay)
I was sippin' on bourbon for you at my soul too bad
Just this your luck (too bad)
Sees a magazine could make the scene anything to fill my cup
Coulda changed the world but this porn on my laptop had me stuck
Step in and blow up the spot like a landmine
Devil throwing his punches, I land mine
What kinda man fall in love with his mankind
Type of brother that'd bleed for a brother
They say remember Him by drinking red wine
When He called, I heard it through the grapevine
In between love and hate is a thin line
Law between love and hate is a big God

Yesterday's price, not todays' price (expensive)
Yesterday's price, not todays' price (my God, expensive)
Yesterday's price, not todays' price (expensive)
Yesterday's price, not todays' price (my God, expensive)
Oh you, oh you mad now that the price up 
Yeah, I know you mad now that the price up 
Yeah, I know you mad now that the price up 
Oh you mad now that the price up (yeah)
