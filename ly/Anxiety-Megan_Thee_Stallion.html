		  Yeah
Just take a sip right quick (Go Grizz)
Just got a lot to get off my chest (huh)

I'm a bad bitch, and I got bad anxiety
People call me rude 'cause I ain't lettin' 'em try me
Sayin' I'm a ho 'cause I'm in love with my body
Issues, but nobody I could talk to about it
They keep sayin' I should get help
But I don't even know what I need
They keep sayin' speak your truth
And at the same time say they don't believe, man
Excuse me while I get into my feelings for a second
Usually I keep it down, but today I gotta tell it
Not that anybody gives a fuck anyway
But everybody talkin' shit probably sucks anyway
Y'all don't even know how I feel
I don't even know how I deal
Today I really hate everybody
And that's just me bein' real, yeah

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Bad bitches have bad days too
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, bounce back
How a bad bitch always do
All I really wanna hear is, "It'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
All I really wanna hear is, "It'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days

If I could write a letter to Heaven
I would tell my mama that I shoulda been listenin'
And I would tell her sorry that I really been wildin'
And ask her to forgive me, 'cause I really been tryin'
And I would ask please, show me who been real
And get 'em from around me if they all been fake
It's crazy how I say the same prayers to the Lord
And always get surprised about who he take, man
I'm really thinkin' 'bout dialin' 911 'til I freak
'Cause they probably won't think it's that deep
And I don't do drugs, so I never get a time when I'm at ease
I can't even handle smokin' weed
Marilyn Monroe, my favorite ho
My favorite bad bitch, I think she the GOAT
Jammin' to Britney, singin' to Whitney
I just wan' talk to somebody that get me, yeah

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Bad bitches have bad days too
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, bounce back
How a bad bitch always do
All I really wanna hear is, "It'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
All I really wanna hear is, "It'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Bad bitches have bad days too
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, bounce back
How a bad bitch always do
All I really wanna hear is, "It'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
All I really wanna hear is, "It'll be okay"
Bounce back 'cause a bad bitch can have bad days
