		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you everything
Descending underneath
Crying out
Will you save me?

Just below the surface
It's rising up
This pain I cannot hide
I know it's not enough
It's not enough

I'm running away from my heart
Just bringing me back to the start
I try to escape but I'm drowning
I keep dreaming that this won't last
We're both heading for a crash
Now I'm awake and still bleeding

I know it's just a dream
But it seems so real to me
Walls are closing in
This air is running thin
The clock is ticking now
Still reaching for a way out

'Cause I'm running away from my heart
Just bringing me back to the start
I try to escape but I'm drowning
I keep dreaming that this won't last
We're both heading for a crash
Now I'm awake and still bleeding

(Is this just a dream?)
(Is this just a dream?)
It seems so real to me

I'm still running away from my heart
Just bringing me back to the start
I try to escape but I'm drowning
I keep dreaming that this won't last
We're both heading for a crash
Now I'm awake and still bleeding
