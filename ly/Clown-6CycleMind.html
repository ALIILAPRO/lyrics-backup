		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe you see me I?m always happy 
But in my back, I?m a lonely clown 
Every time I wake up it seems 
Your face I want to see in smile 

Try to hold me one more time 
Bring me back from where I start 
Chances are not yet fading but 
The clown starts to cry 

Hard to say that I really need you 
I can't pretend that I'm 
Still inlove with you 

Don't get me wrong 
'Coz I know you still hear me 
Don't get me wrong 
'Coz I know you still feel me 

Hold me tight one more tight 
Bring me back from where I start 
Chances are not yet fading but 
The clown starts to cry 

Maybe you see me I'm always happy 
But in my back I'm a lonely clown
