		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop, drop
Shut 'em down, open up shop, singin'
Whoa, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

I'm goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper, baby
Cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to the pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I got that wood grain with the leather seats
I got the windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
Smokin' on that doja
Four of my buddies in the back screamin'
No Limit soldiers

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Doggy, Dr Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
'Cause you know we're about to rip stuff up

Give me the microphone first
So I can bust it like a bubble
LA and Nashville together, man
You know you in trouble
It ain't nothin' but a G thing, baby
Young, locked out people, so we're crazy

Remember walking you from school and homies hate me
But I ain't trippin' 'cause I know one day
Girl, you'll be my lady
You'll probably have my babies, I know it sounds crazy
But thugs need love
If you real, girl, save me

Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's the first of the month
Get up, get up, get up
Cash your checks and get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's the first of the month
Get up, get up, get up, everybody singin'

Give me two pairs
'Cause, I need two pairs
So I can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

Sayin' Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags
Baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark
We can smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
You stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
Selling tapes from here to Hong Kong

So roll, roll, roll my joint
Pick out the seeds and stems
Feeling high as hell, flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coupe De Ville
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell
I bet my Caddy will

I wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty inch blades on my Impala
Caller gettin' paid tonight
Swisher rolled tight, gotta sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money then fly away
But there's got to be a better way
Better way, better way, yeah

Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night, I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name's Mariah, she went to junior high with me
I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last"

She said, what would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
And he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lockdown, I ain't got a job now
Just for you, this is just a good time
But for me, this is what I call life, yeah
