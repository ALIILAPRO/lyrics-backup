		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My stone wall it's on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi okay okay feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight one midnight lamp lit twenty four seven
Murdered out windows two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it not goin' out shit's 'bout ta get kamikaze
Fuck a Nazi
When the world comes knocking
Fuck the world fuck this body
Know it won't be long be now
Feel my nerves wet my brown
Mood in my tomb red moon heavy
Sling jaw shot out the window and yell
Come up and get me

I'm epiphanic amnesia
I'm in Jimmy Page's castle
I'm off the planet
Echo astral
Final lasso
The Sacto asshole
I'm not down for anything
Fuck around and say anything

My stone wall it's on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi okay okay feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight one midnight lamp lit twenty four seven
Murdered out windows two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it not goin' out shits 'bout to get kamikaze
Fuck a Nazi

Come up and get me
My life is a fuck
Ain't one thing I don't hate
Tell me my times almost up
I will say I can't wait
Put your gun to my head
I'll blow smoke in your face
Think you got what it takes
Come up and get me

Can't tell hell in my head
Thirteenth bell am I dead
Or in asylum pill force fed
Lyin' to myself all by myself
Strapped down to my bed
Tongue cut out the mouth of reason
And chucked off the rivers edge
Think fast is it tear gas or fear masked
By figments of my fragmented mind
Who's my enemy them or me
Step to me and you'll die
Grand delusions magnified
Fuck the truth wastes my time
It's all good bet what's that
Footsteps on the stairs
Never could rest they're always there
Who are they? I don't care
I just know they're tryin' to X me
Give a fuck, come up and get me
