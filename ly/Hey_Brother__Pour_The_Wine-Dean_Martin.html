		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we sit enjoying the shade
Hey brother, pour the wine
Drink the drink that I have made
Hey brother, pour the wine

Tell you why the day is sunny
I'm in love with lips of honey
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

She is coming here to stay
Hey brother, pour the wine
I have waited for the day
Hey brother, pour the wine

She writes of love in every letter
Others have tried but I will get her
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

What is life? what is spring?
What are all the stars that shine?
Love, my friend is everything
And love will soon be mine

Pour it as quickly as you can
Hey brother, pour the wine
Pour it quickly once again
Hey brother, pour the wine

She's here at last my one and only
Goodbye friends and don't be lonely
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

Blink your eyes and love has passed
Hey brother, pour the wine
Her's was never made to last
Hey brother, pour the wine

She introduced me to another
No my friends, he's not her brother
I will miss the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

Pour the wine, pour the wine
Hey brother, pour the wine
Pour the wine
