		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud

I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling
Whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

But I feel something 
When I see you now
I feel something
When I see you

If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes

I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me
How much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

But I feel something 
When I see you now
I feel something
When I see you

I used to light you up
Now I can even get you
To play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

But I feel something 
When I see you now
I feel something

I'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in
