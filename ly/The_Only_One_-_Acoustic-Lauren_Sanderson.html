		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't the only one, yeah
La, la, la
Hmm
La, la, la
Hmm
La, la, la
Hmm mm
Yeah

You hit my phone
It go like la, la, la, la, la
You only call me for that na, na, na, na, na
Said something, something
Bout that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You ain't the only one, no
You ain't the only one
That's hittin me up

You hit my phone
It go like la, la, la, la, la
You only call me for that na, na, na, na, na
Said something, something
Bout that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You ain't the only one, no
You ain't the only one

I'm at the function
You always call with assumptions
Always some who, why, or what shit
Causing abstruction
On my so what shit
I'm on my I-I-I don't give a fuck shit
The fuck is that tone?
I was just minding my business
You and your mind and your feelings
Get in the way
I'm running away
And, and press decline

You hit my phone
It go like la, la, la, la, la
You only call me for that na, na, na, na, na
Said something, something
Bout that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You ain't the only one, no
You ain't the only one
That's hittin' me up
You
That's hittin' me up
You
Ain't the only one
You
That's hittin' me up
You ain't the only one
Yeah

You ain't the one
You ain't the only one askin' for trust
You ain't the only one offering drugs
You ain't the only one texting me
Talking 'bout liquor and love
You just want my stuff
Do you know that I know you just wanna (uh)
All on my (uh)
All of you reaching out
Now that the whole world is talkin 'bout
How I'm about to blow up
The fuck is that tone?
I was just minding my business
You and your mind and your feelings
Get in the way
I'm running away
And press decline

You hit my phone
It go like la, la, la, la, la
You only call me for that na, na, na, na, na
Said something, something
Bout that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
You ain't the only one, no
You ain't the only one
That's hittin' me up

You
(That's hittin' me up)
You
Ain't the only one
You
(That's hittin' me up)
You ain't the only one

That's hittin' me up
You ain't the only one
I press decline
