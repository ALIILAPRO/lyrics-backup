		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got the look
Damn right, she owns it
She'll break your heart in this bar and she knows it

She'll ask you for light
Keeps one in her pocket
She'll get ya just enough to get you walking
Right outside end of the night
Watching sparks fly from a Marlboro light

But you don't want that smoke
The kind that's in her past
She'll love you 'til the filter and leave you in the ash
Well, take it secondhand from a fool who knows
You think you're just taking a drag
But you're playing with the fire that'll burn you if you get too close
And you don't want that smoke

Yeah, she'll get you hooked, might even call you "baby"
But she's a one way ticket that drops you off at crazy
Yeah, she'll take your hand
Might even cloud your head
But if you breathe her in, you'll be breathing out an SOS

And you don't want that smoke
The kind that's in her past
She'll love you 'til the filter and leave you in the ash
Well, take it secondhand from a fool who knows
You think you're just taking a drag
But you're playing with the fire that'll burn you if you get too close
And you don't want that smoke
You don't want that smoke

Take it secondhand, I been her fool before
You think you're just taking a drag
But you're playing with the fire that'll burn you if you get too close

She's got the look
And I've got the lighter
And I'm drunk enough to bum off of her tonight

Won't be the first
Won't be the last
You can judge me all you want
But you can't say that
You don't want that smoke
