		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Worried sky
In need of something green to sleep at night

Aiming high,
We're living restless, but it's you and I

Can see we are the shade, the fire and rain
True work of art is not a thing we change

Aiming high,
We're living restless, but it's you and I

Tried to keep our colours inside the lines, inside the lines
But it's hard to draw emotions in troubled minds, inside the lines

Bold and brave,
Compared to others we just paint them grey,
Here to stay,
Know that the two of us won't fade away

Can see we are the shade, the fire and rain
True work of art is not a thing we change,

Hard to hide,
You move me like the moon that pulls the tide

Tried to keep our colours inside the lines, inside the lines,
But it's hard to draw emotions in troubled minds, inside the lines
