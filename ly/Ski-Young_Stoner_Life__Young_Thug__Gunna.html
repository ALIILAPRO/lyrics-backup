		  Woo
(A Tsunami)
Spider, SEX

Yeah, yeah (woo)
Yeah (woo), yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah), yeah
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

The price I want for a show, you 'gon need three promoters (woo)
I got the body from Jim Ellis but I had switched the motor (skrrt)
I got these badass bitches ridin' 'round this bitch and they all the coldest (yeah)
I just told her make a store run (yeah)
I just bought all the Trojans (yeah), yeah (yeah)
I told her stay out my mentions (yeah)
I told her stop tellin' everything she seen
And told her, "Meet me at the Ritz" (let's go)
I got baguettes in the back of my ring
And I wasn't even tryna hit (wasn't even tryna, yeah, yeah)
I told her she gotta run through the team
Before she can talk to the lick ('fore she can talk to the) yeah (yeah)
Lamb chop, I just pulled up in some food (skrrt, skrrt)
I told lil' mama, "Tie all my shoes" (my shoes)
Showed her two million cash, now she woozy (yeah, whoa)
Twenty watches and I'm still snoozin' (twenty)
I had came up out the trenches
Then I had beat a few bodies like Boosie
She said, "You murk 'em, I show you my coochie"
I had to sing to this bitch like lil' Toosie (woo)

Yeah, yeah (woo)
Yeah, yeah (ski)
Yeah, yeah (ski)
Yeah, yeah (let's go)

Bitch got a Backwood on her nightstand
She must be fuckin' with Gunna (yeah, yeah)
I fuck with slatts and we come to eat racks
And I came with some fuckin' piranhas (yeah)

All this Biscotti I got in my 'Wood
Need somebody grow me a tree (tree)
Came out the hood, now my trunk got a hood
Now I crank up the car with no keys
Beat it, she for the street-neet-neets
Only once, she got hit at the 'spinini
I feel a 'lil rich this week
To influence my family to not be cheap (be cheap)
I tote an FN on me (yeah)
Call Neechie-Neech, it's a Glock he keep (ah)
Duke Rollin' 60's, he locked in C's (Rollin')
We roll in that coupe with the bucket seats (bucket seats)
Got out that mud like a football cleat
I used to trap out of that four-door Jeep (four-door)
Call up the plug and he know what I need (know what I need)
Stay on her knees so we hardly speak (hardly speak), yeah
I'm in New York counting shmoney, yeah
Ain't the stuntman, but I'm stuntin', yeah
Wunna, these vibes wanna love me, yeah
Not wifey, and no lovey-dovey (woo)

Yeah, yeah (woo)
Yeah, yeah (ski)
Yeah, yeah (ski)
Yeah, yeah (let's go)

Bitch had an Act' stain on her jeans
I know she fucking with Thugger (yeah, yeah)
I fuck with slatts and we come to eat racks
And I came with some fuckin' piranhas (yeah)

(A Tsunami)
