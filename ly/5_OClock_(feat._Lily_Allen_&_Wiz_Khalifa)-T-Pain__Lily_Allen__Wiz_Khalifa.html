		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (uh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (uh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (uh) and I was hoping

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it
Cause you've been waiting on me since I said that I was hittin' the club

Something coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
'Cause you be sending me texts saying
Like boy just get your ass up in that car and come get all of this love

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come home on time she might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (oh)
And then ask me kindly (oh)
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night and then we always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o'clock in the morning (yeah)
Conversation got boring (talk to me girl)
You said you're goin' to bed soon (let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (c'mon)
And I thought I'd just wait there (wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I wont let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (alright)
And I was hoping you would creep in

(Goodnight) It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck up to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping (oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like "What is he doing?" oh what is he doing?
Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
You texting me like I'm a kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club and you do know what time it is

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Oh my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin' and I know that you mad girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me (no no no)
and then ask me kindly (no no no)
Do I want her to go crazy
We do this every night and then we always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o'clock in the morning (yeah)
Conversation got boring (talk to me girl)
You said you're goin' to bed soon (let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (c'mon)
And I thought I'd just wait there (wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (alright)
And I was hoping you would creep in (baby girl goodnight)

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
Said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck up to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
You ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at six, left around four thirty yeah so by the time I'm at your crib
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
And you yawning, but I've been drinking all night and I feel like performin'
With you in the bedroom floor to the dresser
Don't want nothing less 'cause I'm sure you're the best you're the one so I let you
That's how you show me love
And when we finish you like "damn, babe you woke me up"
I love you way you put it down likes it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're goin' to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
