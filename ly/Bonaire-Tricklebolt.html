		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The feeling was so odd
But you waited far too long 
Now it leaves you reeling
While the the rest is all gone
Gone

This plane is leaving
You waited too long
This plane is leaving
And now you're all alone

Oh, so many thoughts
And feelings that can hardly be ignored
You even start to wonder
Was I meant to be on board?

This plane is leaving
You waited too long
This plane is leaving
And now you're all alone


This plane is leaving
You waited too long
This plane is leaving
And now you're all alone

This plane is leaving
You waited too long
This plane is leaving
And now you're all alone
