		  Thank you, Ralph
If we do the unthinkable
Would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (Baby)
If you ask me, I'm ready (Mally Mall)
Oh my God

I fuck with you 'cause I fuck with you
When I'm switchin' states and not with you, I'm uncomfortable (aw, yeah)
You out there on the DL, I know all your whereabouts (Uh-huh)
Soon as you get right next to me, I'ma eat it like Lunchable (oh my God)
Love how you treat me
I'm in it all night long (I'm in it all night long)
So I bought you a CC (bought you)
The matchin' sets with the thong (yeah, yeah)
(Oh my God)

Even though I'm young, I be on some grown man shit
House out they way, they almost finished with the landstrip
'Bout to buy a private jet, shout out to my management
Never run away from problem, when it get up, we gon' handle it
Convicted felon, half a million dollars show in Canada
She give me the head first, it boost all my stamina
Eight plus all my section, plus, we fuckin' like we animals
Eat it up like Hannibal, we made out in a Phantom
Who the fuck you do it for? I do it for Atlanta
They ain't been through shit for real so they won't understand 'em
Taught my bros to never fuck my bros, they know to stand up
I just left the Grammys, took a PJ to Miami
I know what I did but I won't go against the family
How the fuck you come off accusin' instead of askin'?
None of that shit matter, for real, I hope we get past it
Pull up at my mansion, we gon' get action

I fuck with you 'cause I fuck with you
When I'm switchin' states and not with you, I'm uncomfortable (aw, yeah)
You out there on the DL, I know all your whereabouts (Uh-huh)
Soon as you get right next to me, I'ma eat it like Lunchable (oh my God)
Love how you treat me
I'm in it all night long (I'm in it all night long)
So I bought you a CC (bought you)
The matchin' sets with the thong (yeah, yeah)
(Oh my God)

When I yell, you yell back, you want all the smoke (You do)
The only thing that keep you quiet, dick all on your throat (On your throat)
We fight and fuss and then we fuck, then it all be joke (All be joke)
I can only take care of you, provide for my faults (Oh my God)
Adderall, Perc', had me geeked, geeked (Had me geeked, geeked)
Thought you was gon' turn into a freak, freak (Into a freak, freak)
Then of course, she sucked it sloppy, she ain't neat, neat (She ain't neat, neat)
When it come to nine seconds, she won't beat, beat (She won't beat, beat)

I was wonderin' maybe
If I made you my baby
And we do the unthinkable
Would it make us look crazy?
'Cause if you ask me, I'm ready (ready)
Instead of askin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
We gon' get nasty (Oh my God)

I fuck with you 'cause I fuck with you
When I'm switchin' states and not with you, I'm uncomfortable (aw, yeah)
You out there on the DL, I know all your whereabouts (Uh-huh)
Soon as you get right next to me, I'ma eat it like Lunchable (oh my God)
Love how you treat me
I'm in it all night long (I'm in it all night long)
So I bought you a CC (bought you)
The matchin' sets with the thong (yeah, yeah)
(Oh my God)
