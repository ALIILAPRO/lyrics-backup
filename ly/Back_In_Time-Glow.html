		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slowly
Will you promise me that I'll be one and only
Can't you feel the rush?
Don't leave
All the memories of you are fading slowly
Will the time pass by?

Everytime you pick me up
I fly
Through the night touch the skies so high
I don't wanna lose my mind
Tonight
Fill me up hold me down

So don't you wanna
Follow me through
All the days we’ve
Been so into
One another
Can't you take me
Back in time when
I couldn't breath without you
I don't wanna lose my mind
Tonight
Fill me up hold me down
So don't you wanna
Follow me through
All the days we’ve
Been so into

So don’t you wanna

So don’t you wanna

Slowly
I remembered all the times you left me lonely
Was it all enough
Can't feel
Anything you say it sounds like you're lying
I don't want your love

Everytime you pick me up
I fly
Through the night touch the skies so high
I don't wanna lose my mind
Tonight
Fill me up hold me down

So don't you wanna
Follow me through
All the days we’ve
Been so into
One another
Can't you take me
Back in time when
I couldn't breath without you
I don't wanna lose my mind
Tonight
Fill me up hold me down
So don't you wanna
Follow me through
All the days we’ve
Been so into

So don’t you wanna

So don’t you wanna

Playing the games you've made
But it made me hate you instead
Why do you feel so cold
Like I want you but your love is sold

So don't you wanna
Follow me through
All the days we’ve
Been so into
One another
Can't you take me
Back in time when
I couldn't breath without you
I don't wanna lose my mind
Tonight
Fill me up hold me down
So don't you wanna
Follow me through
All the days we’ve
Been so into

So don’t you wanna

So don’t you wanna
