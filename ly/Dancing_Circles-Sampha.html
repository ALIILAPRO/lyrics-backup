		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

(Madness) madness
Sittin' by traffic
Outside in London
Just waitin' for you (you, ooh)
Blackness (blackness)
Flickering flashes (flash-flash-flash-flash)
Lookin' at the ashes
Look up and you're here in full view (view)
We talk about life (life)
Talk about children, look in your eyes
Talk about crimes (crimes)
Government lies like ain't nothin' new
Had you tremblin' (tremblin')
By the roadside on the Northside (Northside)
We talk about movement (movement)
We talk about how, how we missed the groove

Dancin', dancin'
Hand in hand, would you go?
Dancin', come close
Hold me, hold me so much so we both let go (both let, both let)
Glancin', you know I love it though (know I love it though)
Recollectin' moments back in Mexico
Dancin', come close
Hold me, hold me so much so we both let go

Need a break in wahala ('hala)
Wake, like a come up
Breakin, chasin' the dollar
I wanna feel your love like summer
I wanna feel your love like thunder
Pink hair, salmon (salmon)
Heartbeat (heartbeat), heartbeat like elephant
We were night creatures (creatures)
Runnin' off adrenaline
It's been a little long time (time)
Since I talked all night 'til the birds fly by (fly by)
We talked about minds (minds)
Talkin' 'bout, mh, the feedback it grew
Head on pirouette (pirouette)
Spinnin' with your cigarette, spinnin' like launderette (launderette)
Spinnin' out all the stress, spinnin' out all the sweats
Spendin' nights with you

Dancin' (dance), dancin'
Hand in hand, would you go?
Dancin' (dancin' with you)
Come close (come, come close would you?)
Hold me, hold me so much so we both let go
Glancin', you know I love it though (know I love it though)
Recollectin' moments back in Mexico (oh, yeah)
Dancin', come close (come close)
Hold me, hold me so much so we both let go

Sinkin' in how you feel (sinkin' in how you feel)
Thinkin' how much you've changed (thinkin' how much you changed)
Swimmin' in (swimmin') how we feel
Being apart again

Dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin'
Time travels memories
Uh, we were two birds
Flying away from each other
Lookin' for each other
Time travels memories
Uh, we were two birds
Flying away from each other
Lookin' to recover
