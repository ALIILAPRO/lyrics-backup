		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't a song
for the brokenhearted

No silent prayer
for the faithdeparted

I ain't gonna be just a face
in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live
while I'm alive
It's my life

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just wanna live
while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones
who stood their ground

For Tommy and Gina
who never backed down

Tomorrow's getting harder
make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live
while I'm alive
It's my life

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just want to live
while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall
when they're calling you out
Don't bend don't break
baby don't back down

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live
while I'm alive
It's my life

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just want to live
while I'm alive
It's my life
