		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Asking for forgiveness as you fight to stay alive
Waiting for your heart to be revived

Walking through the shadows
As the darkness turns to light
Destiny has proven to be right

But as your future fades away
It is the price you’d have to pay

When there’s no angels to save you
There’ll be no stairway to your paradise
When there is no more believing
It makes no difference between what’s good or evil

And as you‘re halfway to heaven
And you’ve been grasping for a holy lie
There’ll be no after forever
No more farewell
There’ll be no halos in hell

All they ever wanted was for you to stay in line
Feeding you with lies about the end
Fill your head with fabels
As they hide away from light
Scamming souls corruption they defend
