		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will be your shoulder to cry on
I will make you laugh if you need
I will play the part if you say so
Yeah, I'll be anybody but me

To tell you the truth, I'm a mess, I'm a fool
You don't know that
And you never will
In my mind, it's instilled not to show that

I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
And I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya? 
Designed to deceive
So tell me who you want me to be

I can wear a million faces
'Cause I don't like the one underneath
Always found it easy to fake it
Yeah, I'll be anybody but me

To tell you the truth, I'm the fraud in the room
And I know that
But you never will
In my mind, it's instilled not to show that

I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
And I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I feel like everything I do is a lie
And all the words just further pull the wool over eyes
I know I'm no good at being who I am away from the light
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
Designed to deceive
So tell me who you want me to be

And I'll be
Be my best impression of what you expect from me
But what you don't see

Is I spend almost all of my time
Feeling like I'm falling even further behind
I know I'm so good at seeming
Like I'm not on the edge of a knife
I feel like everything I do is a lie
And all the words just further pull the wool over eyes
I know I'm no good at being who I am away from the light
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya?
And I'm an imposter, but Hell is a mender
I'm the pretender, what can I tell ya? 
Designed to deceive
So tell me who you want me to be
