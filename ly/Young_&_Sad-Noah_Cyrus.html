		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey bud, this is ol' dad
Just wanted you to know, you ain't alone
Keep a smile on your face
Everything's gonna be fine
I love you

They say you should smile more
Darlin', show your eyes more
Aren't you satisfied?
I'm tired of trying to please some
Wonder does it even 
Care what's on my mind?

Let me go, I don't need you to wipe my tears
Don't you know I'm only trying to disappear

Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Don't wanna feel numb or mad until I go under
And I know that you only want me to be happy
But I still feel lonely tonight
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Another day longer

My sister's like sunshine
Always bringing good light 
Wherever she will go
Yet I was born on rain clouds
When they blew the flame out 
Blessed in her shadows

So let me go, I don't need you to wipe my tears
Don't you know I'm only trying to disappear

Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Don't wanna feel numb or mad until I go under
And I know that you only want me to be happy
But I still feel lonely tonight
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Another day longer
Yeah, yeah, mmh

Don't wanna be young and sad, yeah
Don't wanna be young and sad
Don't wanna be young and sad, yeah
Don't wanna be young and sad another day longer
Don't wanna feel numb or mad until I go under
