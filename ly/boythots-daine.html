		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Fuck me like I'm a star (you want some real shit)

Steppin' in the club in my vegan UGGs
Slappin' all these hoes in my Prada puff
They say daine you tweaking hard, I'm off the powder stuff
You can find me in the back, bitch I'm countin' up

I don't want no friends, its too much drama
They say they hate me now, that's not my problem
Boy don't try pull up at the function
Meet me at the hotel and come suck this

Treat that boy like a slut, that's what he is
Fuck me like I'm a star, you want some real shit
Fast car whippin' that thing, 'cause I can now
Don't take pictures of me, just keep your mouth shut

Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)

He wanna cuff me but I want racks
He in his feelings, I'm in my bag
Bitch you wanna kiss me? I don't like that
Don't try to talk to me unless your money fat
Ima hit London for summer, need new side piece
I never check the price, I jus' swipe shit
Keep it 99 'cause I be lying
That boy been passed around
He a flight risk

Treat that boy like a slut, that's what he is
Fuck me like I'm a star, you want some real shit
Fast car whippin' that thing, 'cause I can now
Don't take pictures of me, just keep your mouth shut

Treat that boy like a slut, that's what he is
Fuck me like I'm a star, you want some real shit
Fast car whippin' that thing, 'cause I can now
Don't take pictures of me, just keep your mouth shut

Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
Treat that boy like a slut (that's what he is)
