		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today, I feel like pleasing you
More than before
Today, I know what I want to do
But I don't know what for
To be living for you
Is all I want to do
To be loving you
It'll all be there
When my dreams come true

Today, you'll make me say
That I somehow have changed
Today, you'll look into my eyes
I'm just not the same
To be any more than all I am
Would be a lie
I'm so full of love
I could burst apart
And start to cry

Today, everything you want
I swear it will all come true
Today, I realize how much
I'm in love with you
With you standing here
I could tell the world
What it means to love
To go on from here
I can't use words
They don't say enough

Please, please listen to me
It's taken so long to come true
It's all for you, all for you
