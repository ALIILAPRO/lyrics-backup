		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are again, Where you not here to hold me
Life ain't always fair, Separate words that we love
And the dreamy, Waking light
Of his love, Yeah
My sunrise
And I reach for you every time

Wherever you are
I can feel you thinking of me
Face to the sun
I just need you here beside me
Wherever you are
Even though you thinking of me
It's so hard
I just need you here

On my mind, You stay
Spending all of my time in your sun rays
But its okay darling, I'll be safe yeah
My sunrise, You're my sunrise

Wherever you are
I can feel you thinking of me
Face to the sun
I just need you here beside me
Wherever you are
Even though you thinking of me
It's so hard
I just need you here

I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here

I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here

Yeah, Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
My sunrise, Yeah
My sunrise

Wherever you are
I can feel you thinking of me
Face to the sun
I just need you here beside me
Wherever you are
Even though you thinking of me
It's so hard
I just need you here

I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here

I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here
I just need you here
