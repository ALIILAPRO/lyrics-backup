		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something like no other never seen before
Searching for the keys I will open up some doors
Get your self together we are about to go to war
I just can't believe that you would let me go ignored
Better get your self together now
Be prepared I'm about to turn this place upside down
Better know where your place is
Your just one of a billion faces
Oh I thought you loved me
Guess you don't
What the fuck are you talking about
Who you speaking on the phone too
I've been calling and calling
Still get your answer phone
Call me when your back at home
Im not sure what this feeling is
Let me know when your feeling it
And you probably don't give a shit
But I hope you can live with this
Yeah tell me something better
Before you kick me out the door
You know that I hate this shit don't wanna be ignored
You just don't understand
You don't get it baby
All the shit that you caused me
Just going to kill me lately
Yeah know its better before hand
Let me know when your more planned out baby
From the night to the morning
And ill be waiting for you
And they will be waiting for two of us
Nothing left here to loose
All this shit here is new to us
Oh I thought you loved me
Guess you don't
What the fuck are you talking bout
Who you speaking on the phone too
I've been calling and calling
Still get your answer phone
Call me when your back at home
Im not sure what this feeling is
Let me know when your feeling it
And you probably don't give a shit
But I hope you can live with this
