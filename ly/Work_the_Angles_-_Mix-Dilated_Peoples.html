		  Dilated Peoples
Dilated Peoples
Dilated Peoples (wassup, wassup?)
Dilated Peoples

I work the angles sharp and precise (precise)
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice (Dilated Peoples)
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples (yeah)

The name is Iriscience

I go through rivers (what?) So I don't leave a scent
I travel both directions but leave one set of prints (right)
It's just a little trick, of the indigenous
Developing inner visions of what religion is (uh)
I caught the understanding and the underhanded
I plan to build my ship and man it to another planet
Under heavy surveillance, many different agents
Some are camouflage, others are very blatant (right)
I study weapon systems and vocal fighting forms
I'm many moves ahead, the thoughts are highly formed (yeah)
Like time, times, time, times, time is time squared (what)
Went there, sayin', "Rakaa you don't rhyme fair"
But I never dummy lyrics and they kick it to my people (never)
It's about communication not a rappers ego (right)
Messages I sneak in they seem to seep in 
Mixed with alcohol and weed on the weekend
Shared among friends like various sins
One day it clicks it's no longer dim (no longer dim)
Time release capsules humble the headstrong (uh)
Your thoughts of takin' me head on are dead wrong (what?)

I work the angles sharp and precise (yeah)
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice (Dilated Peoples)
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples (yeah)
I work the angles sharp and precise
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice (Dilated Peoples
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples

It's the master of Aikido
I let go, karate confrontations (yeah)
Evidence scientist in innovation
I locks on when I travels around planets (now, hold on)
Smooth but got a rough edge like Wulitzer pianists (yes, yes!)
Display mucho attack, receive payments for the cadence
A in this, you get fit foul with flagrance
Free agents on the dotted line more hard to sign
Not easily impressed with gold mines and whole nines
I'm somewhere in-between never rushed and in a hurry
And when I swing my bat I don't think I'll miss like baseball fury
The jury's hung, from verdict and got no chance (no chance)
Dilated comes first the rest are second like Stu Lantz

Oh yes it get better every day (yes, yes)
The Aged wine, is my mind on vintage display
Unattended in this case 
(The Ace two steps ahead) 
Every day is Mayday and best friends are Feds (what)
But I know this that's why they closest
In a crisis situation you negotiate first (first)
I'm perfectly focused
Strategic and in a zone 
It was radar detected but my speed was unknown
Anonymity, that's my key to survival
"Ev" is not for Evid, it's for Evidence on trial (it's for what?)
Just remember in this game it take two to tango
Don't go to them let them come to you 
And work the angles (and work the angles)

Sharp and precise
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples
I work the angles sharp and precise
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples (work the angles)

Dilated Peoples
Dila-
Dilated Peoples
Dilated
Dilated
Dilated
Dila-, dila-, dila-
Dilated Peoples
