		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You crash my car, I'll smash a plate
Then I'll go lick all the tears off your face
For better, for worse
It's true, I'll always be there for you
I'll make the bed, you make the tea
Cry and we laugh at our favorite movie
We fight 'til we both lose
And go get our names tattooed

Ain't it strange that we're so messed up
And we love that
You make me so happy, I'm damn sad
If love drives you mad, I'm a maniac
Like Romeo and Juliet
If it kills me to love you, I'll die for that
The world's up in flames while we slow dance
They pull us away but we'll run right back

We're so good together, we're bad for each other
It's true, it kills me to love you

Wearing your favorite dress
Just wanna impress ya
We'll give up the drugs
Do it for love
Be on our best behavior
It just takes one touch
We're back to square one
Give into bliss, is what it is
Chaos is our savior

It's strange that we're so messed up
And we love that
You make me so happy, I'm damn sad
If love drives you mad, I'm a maniac
Like Romeo and Juliet
If it kills me to love you, I'll die for that
The world's up in flames while we slow dance
They pull us away but we'll run right back

We're so good together, we're bad for each other
It's true, it kills me to love you
