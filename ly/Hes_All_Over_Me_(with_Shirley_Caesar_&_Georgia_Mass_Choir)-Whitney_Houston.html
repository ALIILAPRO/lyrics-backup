		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, he's all
He's all over me
He's keeping me alive
He's all over me
He's keeping me alive

He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive
The Lord is keeping me alive
I know he's
He's keeping me alive

He's all over me
He's all in my mind right now
And he's keeping me alive
He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive

He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive, yes, he is
I know the Lord he is
He's keeping me alive
Oh, yes, he is, yeah

He's in my hands
He's in my feet
I can hardly keep my seat
He's in my spirit and my soul

I will never grow old
He's in my heart
He's in my mind
I am glad am I

He's all over me
The Lord is keeping me alive
I know he is keeping me alive
He's keeping me alive

Like the Hebrew boys
Thrown in the fiery furnace
See everybody thought it was over for them
But the Lord brought them out on time

He's the firm foundation
The God of all creation
There's nothing that he won't do for you
You can trust him, he'll see you through

He's all over me
He's all in my mind right now
And he's keeping me alive
He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive

He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive, yes, he is
I know the Lord he is
He's keeping me alive
Oh, yes, he is, yeah

I want to tell you again like the Hebrew boys
They were thrown in the fiery furnace
Everybody thought it was over for them
But the Lord brought them out on time

He's the firm foundation
The God of all creation
There's nothing that he won't do for you
If you trust him he'll see you through

He's all over me
He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive, the boy
He's all over me
He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive
And he'd keeping me alive

He's all over me
All over me
And he's keeping me alive
My Lord is keeping me alive
I know the Lord is keeping me alive
I know he is keeping me alive

He's in my hands and in my feet
I can hardly keep my seat
He's in my spirit and my soul
I will never ever grow old
He's in my heart and in my mind
I'm glad he's mine

He's on the right on the left
Over me, over me
On the front and the back
On the right on the left
Over me, over me
On the front and the back
On the right on the left
Yeah, yeah

He's all over me
He is keeping me alive
He's all over me
He's all over me
And he's keeping me alive
My Lord is keeping me alive

He's all over me
I'm so glad that he is
And he's keeping me alive
He's keeping me alive
I know he is
I know the Lord is keeping me
He's keeping me alive
