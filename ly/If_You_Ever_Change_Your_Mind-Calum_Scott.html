		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hotel rooms, me and you
No words to say so we laid there
I kinda just wished that we'd stayed there
Record straight, you were safe
I was the one needing saving
You were too scared of the craving

I pulled away 'cause the pain's too strong
And you were saying that we don't belong
You're gonna lose me if you wait too long
Tell me what am I to do with this?
I was right at your finger tips
I'm moving on but it's you I miss

If you ever change your mind
I don't know if I'll take you back
But you know that I'll be thinking 'bout that
All night
If you ever change your mind
I told myself I won't relapse
But you know that when you touch me like that
I might

If you ever change your mind (your mind)
If you ever change your mind (your mind)
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind

Far away, made your move
Better off keeping my distance
But I forget with forgiveness
And when I'm alone for long enough
And the rain hits the pavement, the lights are like that
I think of you
And if I held you on last time

If you ever change your mind
I don't know if I'll take you back
But you know I'll be thinking 'bout that
All night
If you ever change your mind
I told myself I won't relapse
But you know that when you touch me like that
I might

If you ever change your mind (your mind)
If you ever change your mind (your mind)
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind

I pulled away 'cause the pain's too strong
And you were saying that we don't belong
You're gonna lose me if you wait too long
Tell me what am I to do with this?
I was right at your finger tips
I'm moving on but it's you I miss

If you ever change your mind
I don't know if I'll take you back
But you know that I'll be thinking 'bout that
All night
If you ever change your mind
I told myself I won't relapse
But you know that when you touch me like that
I might

If you ever change your mind (your mind)
If you ever change your mind (your mind)
Oh, your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
