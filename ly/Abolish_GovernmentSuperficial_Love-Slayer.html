		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Abolish government
There's nothing to it
Forget about God
He's no innocent
We live by a system
Of perfect goals

People vs. people who are bored and old
Life must rest on the man who represents
Looking for nothing in this
Campus with just friends
President the name
President the label

The highest man on the government table
Superficial love only for a fuck
But love is incest and it's only for a fuck
To the guys provided free

Peace time war time country's in vein
All die for this land some over seas
I live for the summons serve my country
Army, Navy, Air Force or jail
To the guys provided for free

Peace time war time country's in vein
But that's the American way what it is to be free
If that's what they call freedom it's not for me
Suck my motherfuckin' dick
