		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know my mind is like a motel
I'm checking out when things don't go well
Sounds like I don't care, I promise I care too much
Mmm
I lose myself in conversations
I hear the words, but I keep spacing
Outside, it's raining, that's all I can think about
I can't focus now (Ah)

I'm a no show, I'm social, then super low
I stay in and quit things without a warning
Is it okay if I turn off? I don't feel like talking
Maybe in the morning

Can I call you when it ends?
When I wanna come down
From the castle on my couch
Where I shut you out
Can I call you when it ends?
When I'm out of feelings
Done with missing out on things
And I'm missing you
Can I call you back?

Sometimes, I wonder what is wrong with me
I always end up feeling so lonely
In a room full of people I call my friends
I wanna call my friends (Ah)

I'm a no show, I'm social, then super low
So I stay in and quit things without a warning
Is it okay if I turn off? I don't feel like talking
Maybe in the morning

Can I call you when it ends?
When I wanna come down
From the castle on my couch
Where I shut you out
Can I call you when it ends?
When I'm out of feelings
Done with missing out on things
And I'm missing you
Can I call you back?

Is it alright, is it alright
If I don't make sense
Even to myself?
Can I call you back again?
When I'm out of feelings
Done with missing out on things
And I'm missing you
Can I call you back?

Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you back?
Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you? Can I call you?
Can I call you back?
Can I call you? Can I call you?
