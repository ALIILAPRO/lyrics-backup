		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the guts and it's the glory
A hundred stripes, a hundred stories
It's the Pledge of Allegiance on the Fourth of July
It's them handwritten letters from home
It's them sleepless nights alone
It's his new born baby he left with his wife

(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) lay down his life
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) for these Stars and Stripes, hey

From the fields of Indiana
To the swamps of Louisiana
To the golden coast of Californ'
Uncle Sam's the only family he's got
His purple heart beat won't stop
And his eighteenth birthday was the day he was born

(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) lay down his life
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) for these Stars and Stripes
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) stand on the front line
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) pay the ultimate price
Oh

He was the man of the house when he was born
His family is proud but torn
But if you knew him, you would understand
He was raised on how to be brave
Just to see the flag still wave
And then he came home with only one hand

He's Mr. Red, White, and Blue, lay down his life
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) for these Stars and Stripes
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) stand on these front lines
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) he'll pay the ultimate price
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) lay down his life
(Mr. Red, White, and Blue) for these Stars and Stripes

March in line
March in line
Hey
Hey
