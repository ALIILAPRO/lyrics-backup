		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last night
About what we want to be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel (feel)

No one knows what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord, how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows what's done is done
It's as if he were dead

(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone)

He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above

Mad
At gods
Mad

He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you

My best friend
My best friend

Whoa, yeah 
Come back

(He as hollow as I alone now)
(He as hollow as I alone now)
