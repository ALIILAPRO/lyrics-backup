		  Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
(Rewind your shit!)

Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt

Still feel sight
For a swing after may
I just wanna run 
With the ice in the play
Climb to the roof
Yeah I'm dripping the Craig 
While I'm whooping the pay
While I'm still in the lane
Still feel sight
For a swing after may
I just wanna run 
With the ice in the play
Climb to the roof
Yeah I'm dripping the Craig 
While I'm whooping the pay
While I'm still in the lane

Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
(Rewind your shit!)

Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt

Still feel sight
For a swing after may
I just wanna run 
With the ice in the play
Climb to the roof
Yeah I'm dripping the Craig 
While I'm whooping the pay
While I'm still in the lane
Still feel sight
For a swing after may
I just wanna run 
With the ice in the play
Climb to the roof
Yeah I'm dripping the Craig 
While I'm whooping the pay
While I'm still in the lane

Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
Call me up
So you know I'm the sun
Ride in a car
With a Bopit in the trunk
Don't even laugh
If you do it for fun
Ready another two three bullets
A blunt
