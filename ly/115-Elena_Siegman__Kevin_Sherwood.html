		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one can see me and

I've lost all feeling and

I know I won't die alone

 

I'll stop you from breathing and

all your deceiving and

this house is not my home

 

Pre chorus 1

No

More forgiveness

No

and the reason is

I know I wont die alone

 

I have returned

 

Chorus 1

and everyone dies and

everyone lies

They're waiting for the second coming again

 

Everyone tries to hold onto their lives

When no one's alive

Bring me 115

 

Verse 2

You stand for nothing and

overlooked something

I'll bring you down all on my own

 

I'm the end I can taste it

I'll justify hatred

I am the chosen one 

left hand of all that's sacred

 

Pre Chorus 2 

No

More forgiveness

No

I'll bring you death and pestilence

I'll bring you down on my own.

 

I have returned

 

Chorus 2

and everything dies

look to the skies

to see the end of all creation again

 

See with your eyes

my army of flies

when no one's alive

bring me 115

 

bridge

I've lost all form and unity

where has my life gone

I'll bring you doom that you can see

and bring you down to see you bleed.

 

 

Outro Chorus

and everyone dies and

everyone lies

They're waiting for the second coming again

 

Everyone tries to hold onto their lives

When no one's alive

Bring me 115

 

and everything dies

look to the skies

to see the end of all creation again

 

See with your eyes

my army of flies

when no one's alive

bring me 115

 

and nobody cries

when everyone dies

and no one's alive

bring me 115
