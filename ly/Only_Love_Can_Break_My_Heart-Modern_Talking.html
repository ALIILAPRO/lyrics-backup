		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're walking like an angel in heaven
In the night I see an angel in you
In my lonely dreams I count to seven
And I call you baby
Know that it is true
When you're young and in love
It's too hot to stop
Young and in love
You never give up

Only love can break my heart
It's tearing me apart
Now I never feel brand new
Only love can break my heart
Playing it's so hard
Nobody love's me like you do

Only love can break my heart
It's time to make a start
Babe, I love you without end
Only love can break my heart
You'll make it if you start
Babe, take me as your friend

Your feelings are tossing and turning
You have to love to pay the right price
Your lonely heart keeps on burning
But an angel will hear many lies
When you're young and in love
It's too hot to stop
Young and in love
You can never give up
