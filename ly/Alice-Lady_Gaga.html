		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Set me free
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Set me free

Could you pull me out of this alive?
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah

Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma
I'm tired of screaming
Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma
At the top of my lungs
Oh my mother, oh my mother
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down, so down, down

My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland

Sick and tired of waking up
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Think I might have just left myself behind
Maestro, play me your symphony
I will listen to anything
Take me on a trip, DJ, free my mind

My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland

Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland

Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland

Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
Set me free
Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah-oh
Set me free
