		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to see their fear
I need them to understand
Let the world sing in despair
We don't belong here anymore
In time they will know

Tremble, as it unfolds
Eyes forced open
Let the world sing in despair
I need to see their fear

Eyes roll back, necks wrung
Essence of death, purest form

Our future, unlearn its existence

Tremble, as it unfolds
Eyes forced open
Let the world sing in despair
I need to see their fear

I need to see their fear
I need them to understand
Let the world sing in despair

Instill them with dread
