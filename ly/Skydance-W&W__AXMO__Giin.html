		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now we get some fun
Don't hold back come on
Until I find your apartment
Even if I can't don't hold back
When I see you it's electric
No, I can't go unaffected
And I still see, now I leave you
Even if I can't, I want you

Hey, call me 'cause I'm waiting
I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you already
I miss you alright, alright
You're riding on my brain waves
Asleep or when I'm awake
Baby, I'm thinking of you
You should be dancing with me

Hey, call me 'cause I'm waiting
I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you already
I miss you alright, alright

Hey, call me 'cause I'm waiting
I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you already
I miss you alright, alright
You're riding on my brain waves
Asleep or when I'm awake
Baby, I'm thinking of you
You should be dancing with me

Hey, call me 'cause I'm waiting
I'm waiting for you, baby
I miss you already
I miss you alright, alright
