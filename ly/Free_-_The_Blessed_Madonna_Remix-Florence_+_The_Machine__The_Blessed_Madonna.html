		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What?
What?
What?

Sometimes I wonder if I should be medicated
If I would feel better just slightly sedated
A feeling comes so fast and I cannot control it
I'm on fire, but I'm trying not to show it

As it picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down
A hundred times a day
It picks me up, puts me down
It chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, puts me down

I'm always running from something
I push it back, but it keeps on coming
And being clever never got me very far
Because it's all in my head
And "You're too sensitive", they said
I said, "Okay, but let's discuss this at the hospital"

As it picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down
A hundred times a day
It picks me up, puts me down
It chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, puts me down

But I hear the music
I feel the beat
And for a moment
When I'm dancing, I am free

I hear the music
I feel the beat (ahh)
And for a moment
When I'm dancing, I am free, I am free

Is this how it is?
Is this how it's always been?
To exist in the face of suffering and death
And somehow still keep singing
Oh like Christ up on a cross
Who died for us? Who died for what?
Oh, don't you wanna call it off?
But there is nothing else that I know how to do
But to open up my arms and give it all to you

'Cause I hear the music, I feel the beat
And for a moment, when I'm dancing
I am free, I am free
I am free, I am free
