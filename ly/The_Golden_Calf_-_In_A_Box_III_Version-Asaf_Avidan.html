		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As you dance around the golden calf
You're spinning down
Showed all the hungry boys in town
What they had missed

They thought that you have found
The echoes of that holy sound
Which got it spat in to the ground
That he had kissed

Your soul was tearing
And a threat was dragged behind you
As you fled into the shadows
Of the bed in which you hid

And as the whisper spread
The colour darkened to a red
That stained to all you ever said
With which you did

And I met you a night
Through a trick of a light
A thousand lifetimes ago

I held your face in my hands
And I traced every line
You never wanted to show

Because I know
We are the children that never let go
We are the children that never let go

As they poured a cross
The borders of your dress
They crossed into the layer
Of the frost around your name

And every one of them was lost
Between the hamer and the cross
That you labelled
And then tossed into the flame

You know I never ment to try
To teach antyhing
But my commandment smashed
When I collided with your hips

And who was I to dare to love you
War has bend to fear
With all the scars that you declare
Across your lips

And I met you one day
Through a crack in the pavement
A thousand silences old

I pulled your chest
To my hand and I pressed
Every cracks that was covered in snow

Because I know
We are the children that never let go
We are the children that never let go
We are the children that never let go

I was forced to scavenge
Through the rotten crates and scalvage
That was broken down
And rubbished by the sea

And as we stepped outside
We saw the coffin that are tied
Of moonlight hid its golden pile
And it was me
