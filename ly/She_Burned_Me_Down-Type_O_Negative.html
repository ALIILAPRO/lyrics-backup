		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  he burned me down, down to the ground

Blood - though thicker than water - is harder to clean up
You&#65533;ll get it in the end boy if the weapon of choice is love
Expecting it from a stranger or maybe an acquaintance
Never from family or friends though a simple mistake and expense

She burned me down, down to the ground

Pissed and disappointed I prey to learn to forgive
If I can&#65533;t find it in my heart then I have no reason to live

Here is an education - the lesson professed is quite cruel
There are some things worse the death and one of them is you

Every time I see her start a fire I get higher
