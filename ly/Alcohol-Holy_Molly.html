		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alcohol
Dancing in the club although I feel alone
You should know
Skin and bone
Memories are crashing like a wrecking ball
All alone
 
Alcohol
Dancing, dancing
Wrecking ball (You should know)
Alcohol
Dancing, dancing
Wrecking ball (You should know)
 
Alcohol
Dancing in the club although I feel alone
You should know
Skin and bone
Memories are crashing like a wrecking ball
All alone
 
Alcohol
Dancing in the club although I feel alone
You should know
Skin and bone
Memories are crashing like a wrecking ball
All alone
 
Alcohol
Dancing in the club although I feel alone
You should know
Skin and bone
Memories are crashing like a wrecking ball
All alone
 
Alcohol
Dancing, dancing
Wrecking ball (You should know)
Alcohol

Memories are crashing like a wrecking ball
All alone

Dancing in the club although I feel alone
You should know
Skin and bone
Memories are crashing like a wrecking ball
All alone
