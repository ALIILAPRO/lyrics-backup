		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay my soul out bare by the river, mm
Let my bridges burn and deliver me, mm
Bring my soul back from the rhythm
Of the chains that got me here
It ain't fair, no, it ain't, mm

Mercy, mercy, mercy
I've no luck with the man upstairs
Help me, help me, help me

Won't you pray?
'Cause she don't hear me like she hears you pray
So just pray for me
Won't you pray?
'Cause I'm too far from Heaven when I pray
So just pray for me

Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah

Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me

Won't you pray?
'Cause she don't hear me like she hears you pray
So just pray for me
Won't you pray?
'Cause I'm too far from Heaven when I pray
So just pray for me

Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me? Yeah
