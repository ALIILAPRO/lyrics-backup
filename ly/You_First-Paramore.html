		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living well is not my kind of revenge
You should take it from me
Living well is just a privilege
Thought I'd simmer down as I got older
Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder
Who invited you?

Just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy and it keeps on coming back
But just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy and it keeps on coming

Everyone is the bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know
Who's the worst
But Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope and I hope, I just hope
She comes, she comes for you first, oh

Which wolf wins? I guess it really depends
Just gotta wait and see
Which one's appetite's the biggest
Turns out I'm living in a horror film
Where I'm both the killer and the final girl
So who, who are you?

Just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy and it keeps on coming back
But just like a stray animal I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy and it keeps on coming

Everyone is the bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know
Who's the worst
'Cause Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope
She comes, she comes for you first, oh

Never said I wasn't petty
Never said I wasn't petty

I never said I wasn't petty
You can bet I don't regret it for a second
It's a pleasure, it's a reckoning
Never said I wasn't petty
I'll do better when you're better
Let me revel in your defeat

Everyone is the bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know
Who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope and I hope, I just hope
She comes, she comes for you first, oh
