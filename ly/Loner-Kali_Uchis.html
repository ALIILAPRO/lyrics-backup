		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be your cigarette
I don't want to be your ashtray
I don't want to be your door mat
Don't want to be ignored
All o' sudden you're not into me
And maybe it's not deliberate
And I know you never asked me
I just gotta put it out there
I don't put myself out there
Usually I stay tucked away
'Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
Mind games, manipulations

That's why I'd rather be a loner
Yeah I'd rather be alone
I don't even want to know ya
I don't want to be known
'Cause I'd rather be a loner
I'd much rather be alone
Baby it was nice to know ya
Packing up and leaving home

No I don't want to be your cigarette
Use me up then toss me, step on me
I don't want to be an option
Avoidin' interaction 'cause
I just want to get away
And maybe you got a full plate
Know I'm cookin' something better
But if you don't want me now
No boy I don't want you later
Don't try to come and eat with me
'Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
Headaches and allegations

That's why I'd rather be a loner
Yeah I'd rather be alone
I don't even want to know ya
I don't want to be known
'Cause I'd rather be a loner
I'd much rather be alone
Baby it was nice to know ya
Packing up and leaving home
