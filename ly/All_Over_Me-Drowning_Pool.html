		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something I just might regret 
Something you will not forget 
Maybe I should throw away 
Everything I've learned today 
All over me 
Pushing forward from the truth 
Maybe it's me and maybe it's you 
Sometimes I don't know myself 
28 years straight to hell 
All over me 
There's something changing in me 
There's something growing in me 
There's something changing in me 
There's something growing inside of me 
Go away 
Don't want this
