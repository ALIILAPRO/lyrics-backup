		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tellin' everybody what you're doin' to me
Tellin' everybody what you're doin'.
Ain't no doubt about it
Girl you drive me wild
Seems you're wastin' over
My punishment befits your crime
I can't stop thinkin' about it
The things you've done to me
Baby you know you've got it
You bring a man right to his knees

I never been an angel
But you could show me how
I wanna be your baby
Na-na-na-na-now

CHORUS
So I'm Tellin' everybody
Tellin' everybody what we did last night
Tellin' everybody
I never had a girl that felt so right
Tellin' everybody
You're the reason why I had a good time

Tellin' everybody what you're doin' to me
Tellin' everybody what you're doin'

Age defies your body
Looks defy my mind
Girl you take me higher
Lady you're perfect defined
So don't stop thinkin' about it
Ain't too much stuff for me
I'll keep workin' it harder
I'll keep it up-won't bother me
I never been an angel
But you could show me how
I wanna be your baby
Na-na-na-na-now

CHORUS

Tellin' everybody what you're doin' to me
Tellin' everybody what you're doin'
Tellin' everybody what you're doin' to me
Tellin' everybody what you're doin'

CHORUS TO FADE
