		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roll of the dice
Take a spin of the wheel
Out of your hands now
So how do you feel?
But you're not gonna win
You'd better go back again
Do you feel lucky 
Or do you feel scared?
Take what luck brings
And the Devil may care
But you're down on your luck
What will the next day bring?

Adrift on the ocean
Afloat in a daydream
Or lost in a maze
Or blind in the haze
So what does it matter?
So why don't you answer?
So why did you send 
An angel to mend?

Best make decisions
Before it's too late
Take all your chances
Take hold of the reins
A roll of the dice
Ahead of the game again

Nothing to lose
But so much to gain
A little danger
It goes without saying
But what do you care?
You're gonna go in the end

Gate open to heaven
Is ready and waiting
Or straight down to hell
Can go there as well
I'll suffer my craving
My soul's not worth saving
So why don't you go?
Just leave well alone

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life? (Hmm)

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life? (Hmm)

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life? (Hmm)

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life? (Hmm)

There's like a hunger
That knocks on your door
You've had a taste of it
Still you want more
You've made your mistakes
Won't play it the same again

You have been warned
But still you plunge in
You play high stakes
But there's nothing to win
You've only one life
And so many things to learn

The Angel on one side
The Devil the other
Which path do you take
Decisions to make
Arrive at the crossroads
You know where you're going
And what if you wait
It may be too late

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?

Don't you think I'm a savior?
Don't you think I could save you?
Don't you think I could save your life?
