		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't care about the hate
Don't care about the game
Don't care about my friends
I've only got myself to blame
Don't care about the issues
Outside of my head
I know you really wouldn't give a fuck
If you learned I was dead

Every man for himself
 independence is the key
You will never understand the shit
I carry on with me
Nobody could comprehend the things that
Go on in my brain
If I spoke my feelings aloud
You'd think I'd gone insane

The older and older I get
I couldn't give a shit
But I just run with it
'cause I can't conquer it
The older and older I get
I couldn't give a shit
But I just run with it
'cause I can't conquer it

Don't care about the hate
Don't care about the game
Don't care about my friends
I've only got myself to blame
Don't care about the issues
Outside of my head
I know you really wouldn't give a fuck
If you learned I was dead

Sometimes I wonder: Will I ever make it?
Letting everyone around me pull me down
But I won't quit
Letting everyone around me make
My decisions for me
Like they living life through my eyes
But they can't fucking see

The older and older I get
I couldn't give a shit
But I just run with it
'cause I can't conquer it
The older and older I get
I couldn't give a shit
But I just run with it
'cause I can't conquer it

Don't care about the hate
Don't care about the game
Don't care about my friends
I've only got myself to blame
Don't care about the issues
Outside of my head
I know you really wouldn't give a fuck
If you learned I was dead
