		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It must have been a year since
I was thrown across an ocean far from home
And I was making oceans
Riding in between the highs and lows

Ooh, when I wake in the morning I
Ooh, it's the first on my mind

Maybe what I miss most
It wasn't made of steel and stones
And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't born of skin and bone
Under the sun, up on the waves
Under three climbs when I'm far away
Maybe what I miss most

And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know

Life beyond the window
I'm jealous of the way the black bird flies
Free among the people
Those quarter million stories pass me by

Ooh, lie awake in the moonlight I
Ooh, it's the last on my mind

And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't made of steel and stone
And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't born of skin and bone
Under the sun, above the waves
Under three climbs and I'm far away
Maybe what I miss most

And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know

I remember at the table
All those faces, where did they go?
I imagine how it looks like
When I'm not there
I remember, every summer
But now that years are, just a number
There's no backwards
Time is faster with everything I've left behind, oh

But maybe what I miss most
It wasn't made of steel and stone
And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't born of skin and bone
'Cause under the sun, above the waves
Under three climbs and I'm far away
Maybe what I miss most

And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know
