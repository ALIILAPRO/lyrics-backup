		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe, I know it's just maybe
And we're only dreaming
For how this will go, o-o-oh

But maybe, one day this daydream
Will turn into real things
For all that we know, o-o-oh

We could be doing anything that we love
Just be carried by the way the wind blows, o-o-oh
You could be doing anything you dream of
If you believe in the things that make you strong

Someday, we'll meet on the high street
We'll laugh about when we
Worried about what we might be

Then maybe, we'll talk about old days
We'll smile in our old ways
You'll always be a part of me

We could be doing anything that we love
Just be carried by the way the wind blows, o-o-oh
You could be doing anything you dream of
If you believe in the things that make you strong

You could be doing anything you dream of
If you believe in the things that make you strong

Maybe, I know it's just maybe
And we're only dreaming
For how this will go, o-o-oh

Just maybe
You could be doing anything you dream of
Maybe
Maybe
