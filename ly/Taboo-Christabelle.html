		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the silence you'll find gold
When you feel warmth, I feel so cold
Can't get no sleep, I'm up 'til dawn
These demons have broken my goal
And I know, and I know, and I know that you see my life
In foreign eyes
And I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry
Tears tell no lie

Let our guards down it's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echoes in my head, got to break the taboo
No we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones, got to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals

I know that I am not alone
Let all our thoughts and ghosts unfold
In the darkness I've found home
But what is next is still unknown
And I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry
Tears tell no lie

Let our guards down it's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echoes in my head, got to break the taboo
No we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones, got to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals

(Animals, animals) break the taboo
Break the taboo (animals, animals)
Break the taboo (animals, animals)

Let our guards down it's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echoes in my head, got to break the taboo
No we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones, got to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
