		<p>
		  This time I want it all
This time I show you all the ways
This time I want it all for me
I be this (?) Know right now
Yeah, still drinking with the same girls that you was before I ieft the city
Brown nigga but you know me now
Stayed the same nigga but I got more experience now
Do you wanna know what I'm on now
I ain't never seen ya trip off one nigga
Don't even make time for a rich nigga
Shawty I just wanna be a coach to ya
I got so much to show you

With all the things that I plan for you now
It's a shame that you not in a plane right now
So hit me first girl when you finally touch down

'Cause I like, I like the way, I like the way
That you posing, shawty
I hope you not shy (you not shy)
To show any of your angles baby

You know I put in the time for love
Doing overtime
Girl you know if you need my time
You just gotta have it
I'm on the other side where it ain't the same
'Cause money choose your mood (?) These days
I pop so much champagne 'cause girl it's time to celebrate

With all the things that I plan with you now
It's a shame that you not in a plane right now
So hit me first girl when you finally touch down

'Cause I like, I like the way, I like the way
That you posing, shawty
I hope you not shy (you not shy)
To show any of your angles baby

Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
Show me all your angles babe
