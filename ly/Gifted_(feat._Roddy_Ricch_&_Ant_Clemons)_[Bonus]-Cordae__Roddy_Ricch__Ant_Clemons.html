		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Livin' out my dream, my life is different (different)
If I want it, then I'ma get it (get it)
Livin' every day like it was Christmas
'Cause I'm gifted (ahh-ahh-ahh)
And I know what my gift is (ahh-ahh-ahh)
And I know that I'm gifted (ahh-ahh-ahh)
And I know what my gift is (ahh-ahh-ahh)
'Cause I'm gifted

Uh, I got a whole lotta people that's been countin' on me
Got this bad lil' shawty goin' down on the D
I met shorty and we connected like the Wi-Fi
Hopped in the Phantom, disappeared like, "Voila"
I told niggas that I would make it they said, "No way"
Watch them niggas that might eat up off your plate
They caught me slidin' on the E-Way with the heat on the seat
I got tennis chains with crosses but I still keep a piece

See, I was twelve years with the Tommy fit
Fifteen, crankin' "Bobby Bitch"
I was seventeen years on this earth, when I popped a Perc, made my body itch
Need a pound to blow, when I'm drownin' slow, I was down below
Word to Roddy Ricch, we was slap boxin', no Karate Kid
Start to see the difference with a lot of shit
And my grandma got a lot of kids
Bought whips for 'em, no mileages
Hit Saks Fifth, and got a Prada fit
But I still got a lotta wallet
Shit, nigga, this the shit that I asked for
'Member last year I was mad poor
Seen my mama cry over homicides
Now she down to fly, she got a passport
And my brother locked for a backdoor
Got my grandmama a new Jaguar
Big body whips like Shaq car
And no credit check, straight Cash Card
Nigga, no stress, I progress
That's Mos Def, like Black Star
Seen the future in my Audemars
Stack paper, don't do no fa√ßade

Uh, I got a whole lotta people that's been countin' on me
Got this bad lil' shawty goin' down on the D
I met shorty and we connected like the Wi-Fi
Hopped in the Phantom, disappeared like, "Voila"
I told niggas that I would make it they said, "No way"
Watch them niggas that might eat up off your plate
They caught me slidin' on the E-Way with the heat on the seat
I got tennis chains with crosses but I still keep a piece

Livin' out my dream, my life is different (different)
If I want it, then I'ma get it (get it)
Livin' every day like it was Christmas
'Cause I'm gifted (ahh-ahh-ahh)
And I know what my gift is (ahh-ahh-ahh)
And I know that I'm gifted (ahh-ahh-ahh)
And I know what my gift is (ahh-ahh-ahh)
'Cause I'm gifted

Uh, I got a whole lotta people that's been countin' on me
Got this bad lil' shawty goin' down on the D
I met shorty and we connected like the Wi-Fi
Hopped in the Phantom, disappeared like, "Voila"
I told niggas that I would make it they said, "No way"
Watch them niggas that might eat up off your plate
They caught me slidin' on the E-Way with the heat on the seat
I got tennis chains with crosses but I still keep a piece
