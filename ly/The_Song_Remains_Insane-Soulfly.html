		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live your life 
Not the way they taught you 
Do what you feel 
Survive the jungle 
Give me blood 
Give me Pain 

These scars won't heal 
Can you take it 
Can you take it
Can you take it
Motherfucker 

What were you thinking 
What a wonderful world 
You're full of shit 
Leave it behind 

They don't care if you cry
All is left is pain 
I won't take it 
I won't take it 
I won't take it 

No 

The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 
The song remains insane 

I remain insane
