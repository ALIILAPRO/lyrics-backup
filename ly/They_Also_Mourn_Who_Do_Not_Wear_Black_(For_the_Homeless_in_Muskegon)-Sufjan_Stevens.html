		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you happen to be educated
Time it marches on,
Oh time it marches on.
In the end there is a sacred show
Delivers every song,
Delivers every song.

Mourning steps and
Mourning gallivants
And mourning never shows,
No mourning never slows.
If the avatar reminds that it
Will never stand at all, 
Will never stand as tall.

Since the water made it,
Most to sail it,
Made it most to song,
It made it most to song.
For the politics are not political
For what they stand,
For not what they demand.
Every senator and diplomat
Combines her certain part,
A matter for the heart.
Save yourself from recognition.
Selfless and quite song
To better get along.

(We love you. We Chose to.
We made to. We love you.)

If we concentrate and pull
Resources to the highest poll,
To beat the highest pull, too.
Ever will we conquer grief
And find it faster to resolve
The dead, to be absolved
And fed, to restore.
If the advantageous
Reprimand misgivings,
We won't grow.
We will not ever know.
We will not!
(Lift my life in healthy places!)
