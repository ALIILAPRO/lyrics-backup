		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost a friend
I can't fight you anymore
I'm tired of choosing you over myself
It's sad
And it hurts that it is over
And I hate the fact that it's over

Sometimes I think if I was more stronger
Sunshine, my smile would last longer
You had my trust and we had choices
But you told my secrets to strangers
(And I hate the fact that we're over)

Years have gone by tears still stain my pillow
You played games with my emotions
Real friends don't leave their wounds open
But I'm okay to say that it's over
Distance and pain made my life feel smaller
I thought without you I'd be broken
I've changed and realized that I can be alone
It's mad and it burns that it is over
And I'm okay to say that it's over
It is over
It is over
It is over
