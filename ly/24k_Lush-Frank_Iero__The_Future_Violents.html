		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more night in solitude removed from everyone
Even though I wanted to I never had much fun. that I know
Do you think of me like I hope you do?

Raise my arms to the sky for once. I'm gold
No, I won't give you up. I can't let you down any more than I have

One more time I promise to revolve around the sun
Is one more year in servitude enough to pay for all I've done?
I don't know
Would you wait for me as I long for you?

Raise my arms to the sky for once. I'm gold
No, I won't give you up. I can't let you down any more than I have

No time for giving eulogies
No time for a second chance
No time for mixed apologies
Tonight we're gold
Tonight we burn down Hollywood
Tonight's our shared last breath
They'll write about us in history books
No time for giving eulogies
No time for a second chance
No time for mixed apologies
Tonight we're gold
Tonight we burn down Hollywood
Tonight's our shared last breath
They'll write about us in history books
Tonight we're gold 
Tonight we're gold 
Tonight we're gold 
Tonight we're gold
