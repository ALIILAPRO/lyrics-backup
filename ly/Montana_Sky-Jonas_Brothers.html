		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got friends in different places
They throw parties in the basement and get high
Got distractions by the river in Virginia 
That could take up all my time

But it's all just thunder in smoke
I've seen the world
You're still the where I want to go

Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one walking in my head
Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one walking in my head

Long, long, New York nights out with my friends
All I see is your silhouette
Oh, Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one, you're the one walking in my head

I got brothers in their thirties back in Jersey 
But your heart is where I'm home (yeah)
I could fill up all my glasses
Maybe move to Calabasas
Say I'd rather be alone

But it's all just thunder in the smoke
Seen the world
You're still the where I want to go

Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one walking in my head
Oh, Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one walking in my head
Long, long, New York nights out with my friends
All I see is your silhouette
Oh, Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one, you're the one walking in my head

(No matter where I go)
(No, no, no matter where I go you're walking in my, uh)

Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one walking in my head
Oh, Montana skies, yeah
You're the one (you're the one walking in my)

Long, long, New York nights out with my friends
All I see is your silhouette (all I see, all I see)
Oh, Montana skies, Georgia sunsets
You're the one, you're the one walking in my head

You're the one, you're the one walking in my head
You're the one, you're the one walking in my head
