		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if you can hear the words I'm sayin' right now
So I'll scream 'em louder
Layin' there with no life left in your soul
It feels like nothin' matters

And I tried callin' you a thousand times
You tried tellin' me a thousand lies
There's no need to apologize
It's not your fault again this time

Promise you won't say goodbye right now
Hold on when you have your doubts
Tell me the things that I don't know
I'll tell you about tomorrow
So sick from all of the scars they left
Searchin' for more than this life can give
At night when you feel all alone
I'll tell you about tomorrow

Now embers' fadin'
Your life's vacant
You feel complacent
You're broken, I'm breakin'

And I tried callin' you a thousand times
You tried tellin' me a thousand lies
There's no need to apologize
It's not your fault again this time

Promise you won't say goodbye right now
Hold on when you have your doubts
Tell me the things that I don't know
I'll tell you about tomorrow
So sick from all of the scars they left
Searchin' for more than this life can give
At night when you feel all alone
I'll tell you about tomorrow

So sick from all of the scars they left
Searchin' for more than this life can give
At night when you feel all alone
I'll tell you about tomorrow
Tell me about tomorrow
Tell me about tomorrow
Tell me about tomorrow
Tell me about tomorrow (tell me)
Tell me about tomorrow (tell me)
Tell me about tomorrow (tell me)
Tell me about tomorrow (tell me)
Tell me about tomorrow
