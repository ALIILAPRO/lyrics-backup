		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing left, now I'm feeling numb
And just like you, I couldn't love someone
There is no one, I can belong to

Take you out, never bring you back again, back again, back again
Can't recall how we lost our innocence, innocence, (innocence)

Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Got no heart to break, like it that way
Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Emptiness is safe, keep it that way

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

On the path of never leading home
Cut it out from my flesh and bone
And I feel like, I can't see anything

Take you out, never bring you back again, back again, back again
Can't recall how we lost our innocence, innocence, (innocence)

Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Got no heart to break, like it that way
Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Emptiness is safe, keep it that way

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Used to be, I had light
I had fire in my chest
Oh, but now I'm all out
And I've got nothing left

Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Got no heart to break, like it that way
Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Emptiness is safe, keep it that way

Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Got no heart to break, like it that way
Nothing in the cage of my ribcage
Emptiness is safe, keep it that way

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
