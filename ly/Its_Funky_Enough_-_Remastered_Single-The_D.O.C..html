		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
An MC ate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothing like an idiot, get it?
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough

It's getting funky, it's getting funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place
It's getting funky, it's getting funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place
It's getting funky, it's getting funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place

If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo I am not a jackass meaning not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
Others say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitching
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the see
When I'm P-E-are-F-O-are-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I engulf
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style I am using
Knowing that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hitting funky enough

It's getting funky, it's getting funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place
It's getting funky, it's getting funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place
It's getting funky, it's getting funky 
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place

Listen to the kick drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowing
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am joking
Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this: "Yo Dre you must stop him"
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static cause that's all I need to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say "Dre yo you're getting funky enough"

It's getting funky, it's getting funky
Deal with the D-O to the see
It's getting funky, it's getting funky
Deal with the D-O to the see
It's getting funky, it's getting funky
Deal with the D-O to the see

I'm your break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sitting down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And the PK nothing giving you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer
Haven't seen you're a hellified dancer
You tried sitting but it just won't work
Cause the beat is to fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough

It's getting funky, it's getting funky
And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

It's getting funky, it's getting funky
And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

It's getting funky, it's getting funky
And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

It's getting funky on the mix now, right
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy
