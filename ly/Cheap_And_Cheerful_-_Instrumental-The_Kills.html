		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm bored of cheap and cheerful
I want expensive sadness
Hospital bills, parole
Open doors to madness

I want you to be crazy cause you're
Boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy cause you're
Stupid baby when you're sane

I'm sick of social graces
Show your sharp tip teeth
Loose your cool in public
Dig the legal meet
'Cause love is just a dialogue
You can't survive on ice cream
You got the same needs as a dog

It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)

I want you to be crazy cause you're
Boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy cause you're
Stupid baby when you're sane

It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)

[Repeat: 2X]
I want you to be crazy cause you're
Boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy cause you're
Stupid baby when you're sane
