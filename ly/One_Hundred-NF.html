		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Hey, I'm on a hundred right now
Yeah

They say the flow soundin' like a mixtape
They ain't see it comin' like a fast break
They ain't see it comin' like Jordan hittin' jumpers, yeah, they ask me
"When that new music 'bout to drop?"
Ain't that what I gave you last week? (Last week!)
Yeah, oh, you done it now
Feels like I'm coming up, but spit it like I'm underground
Wonder how I come into your city like I run the town
Love the sound
Started on a stage, now we in the crowd, woo!
Yeah, what's with the hype though?
Told me that your record was the greatest, but you lied though
Told me they consider you a God, yeah, well I don't
Say you never lived until you found something to die for, woo!
Yeah, and that is so true
Forget the haters, remember people you're close to
Now I'm doing things they told me I ain't supposed to
They treat me like a player, that's funny, I'm here to coach you!
Go back to the bench, know where you belong
Say that you've been practicin', well maybe you should do it more
Say that you the boss, yeah? Well, who did you employ?
All these sucky rappers, I don't listen to them, so annoyed!

I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!

Yeah, you shoulda left this on a high note
Different cities, different time zones
You had me open up for your tour
I leave it lookin' like it's my show
The fans beggin' for the encore, woo!
Yeah, and what you know about
Selling merchandise right out your house?
I got forty boxes in my living room on the couch
Yeah, me and my girl 'bout to ship them out, oh Lord!
Yeah, yeah, I thought I told 'em last record
I'm out here grindin' on a mad level
Always on a hundred, they don't understand the mad hustle
Nah, but that's what happens when the fans love you, I know!
Yeah, I ain't the norm, but I like it though
'Bout to move the family out to Nashville
I'm sleepin' on the floor, got no curtains in the bedroom
Hang up the sheets, yeah, that's the way that I roll!
Yeah, they think the money 'bout to change me
That type of talkin' got me angry, yeah
A lot of people tryna play me
Me and the fan base lookin' like the A-Team, woo
How you tellin' people that we family?
Hold up
Yeah, when you ain't even met me
That's the type of thing that may upset me
That's the type of thing that may upset me

I'm on a hundred! (Hundred)
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey!
We on a hundred! (On a hundred!)
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey! (Woo!)
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred!
Yeah, I said I'm on a hundred right now, hey! (Woo!)
We on a hundred!
Yeah, I said we on a hundred right now, oh!

We on aâ€”we on a hundred right now!
Boy!
Yeagh!
