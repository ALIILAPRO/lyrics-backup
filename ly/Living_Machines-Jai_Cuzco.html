		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come 
A little closer
Hear your voice
Hear my breath
Calling us to leave

Whisper in my ear
No need to fear
To fear

But i dont know why
We gave in
We grew closer
To living machines

But i dont know why
We gave in
We grew closer
To living machines
To living machines

Look into my eyes
Wide open
Feeling guilty when closing

Oh the path we follow
Our minds become hollow
To everything in between

But i dont know why
We gave in
We grew closer
To living machines

But i dont know why
We gave in
We grew closer
To living machines
To living machines

Living machines
Living machines

But i dont know why
We gave in
We grew closer
To living machines

But i dont know why
We gave in
We grew closer
To living machines
To living machines
