		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They came to me, telling me
I will not survive with my tendencies
Desperately begging me to hide
Shamefully scaring me, I will not abide
There will be enemies, jealousies
Helplessly crushing my soul
I know it's my role with this soul in this life
To be endlessly, carelessly, chasing my delights
So, I stole the light
Pretty alright
Caused the night
Jumpstarted the fight
I stole the light
Pretty alright, pretty alright, pretty alright
They're faithfully, daring me
Since I was a child
Dim my legacy, destiny, telling me to keep my head down
Painfully, never see, I can be the light
Be the remedy, ecstasy, heavenly divine
Cause I know it's my role with this soul in this life
To be endlessly, carelessly, chasing my delights
So, I stole the light
Pretty alright
Caused the night
Jumpstarted the fight
I stole the light
Pretty alright, pretty alright, pretty alright
