		  Field the floor i said it wasn't stable
Are you worried at all?
"I thought you guys had cable?"
Breathlessly the cavity you left
Had it's own paywall settle the score, like
Was it really painful?

Spiral let you down easier
If I could i'd let you down easier
Let you down easy

"What in the world
Made you think I'm grateful?" uS '94
I'd call you on the payphone
Eventually, decembering made me drop
The plane low i'd felt it before, like
Further back than April

A tyrant let you down easier
Light work let you down easier
Let you down easy

If I could i would
