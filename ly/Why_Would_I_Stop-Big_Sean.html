		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, whoa
This what they been waiting on?
Critical, ain't no time left on the clock
When it's your time, give 'em something to watch
I picked all the locks 'til I buy up the block
And I know I'm a gift but I think out the box
And they want me to stop, but why would I stop? (Huh)
I am unstoppable (hol' up) why would I stop, bitch?
Why would I stop? Chill (chill), I don't jump, I dive in it
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) This the reason I'm alive, isn't it?

This shit the antidote, this the cure cancer flow
Stop a pandemic and the globe
The product of old Ye chopping up the sample flow
Dilla and Pimp C, the triller, this shit might go too trill for Triller though
I see you critical, I'm not hospitable, favorite rappers I done cut they umbilicals
Red Wings jersey, B.I.G look like Pac
The blacker the berry, more they wan' see it rot
I'm going down as one of the GODS, G-O-D-D-O-A, dead or alive
I'm laying low, they could be espionage
This ain't no walk in the park, you can't slide
Solution to everyone else 'round me problems
Next episode, got the whole fucking world watching
I might leave the series, come back like I'm Rodman
Get it now, or right now, my only two options

So why would I stop, I am unstoppable (hol' up)
Why would I stop, bitch? This shit unstoppable
Chill (chill), I don't jump, I dive in it
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) This the reason I'm alive, isn't it?

The DJ gon' drop this, we made it from scratch
I'm minding my business and all of its black
My dawg on the same way, the mode is attack
I don't complain about life, I adapt
I'm at a point if I fuck with a lil' ho
It's not just a fling, it's a scandal (on God)
I can't be handing out samples (no way)
I can't be having ten baby mamas
That shit sound like a job not a family (straight up)
And I do this shit for the family (straight up)
Yeah, that's just the roots I had planted (God)
D2 this shit the new standard
Upgraded the city, it got a new feeling, the house that I built (whoa)
House in the hills, ain't no hills in the D, so we all in the field (whoa, whoa)
Runnin' shit 5K, 3K Andre (run it, run it)
Hero in my hood, when they dress like me, that's cosplay
Give a fuck 'bout a threat, nigga, I'ma threat leaving out the driveway
I never listen to what the odds say
Why when the universe respond to what I say?
(I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say)
(I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say)
